However, if you're getting the international G930F, know that Samsung pay won't work and Android Pay will be limited.  In addition, if you're expecting faster updates from Samsung, just know they have the G930F extremely fragmented by country and specific firmware to each country... so not all will receive updates as fast as you might expect for a ""carrier free"" device. That said, the Exynos processor on the G930F is superior to the Snapdragon processor in the US variant, as is the battery life.","4.0 out of 5 stars"

I am comparing it to the Note 5 here youtu.be/h4KePwhAmEI and you can see the great design of this phone. The S7 is literally a Galaxy Note 5 shot with a shrink ray. The curved back glass on the phone fits in your palms perfectly compared to the S6. It has impressive design and refined polish throughout.

Best of all you now have removable storage back and I added a 128gb card with no issues. It's too bad the phone didn't come out in 64gb and 128gb. I think Samsung made a mistake going with this route and they should have at least offered it to consumers. The camera is indeed impressive even if it dropped megapixels. It went down to 12 but the lens is amazing. I tested multiple photos and videos with this and the Note 5 and even though it was less megapixels it consistently took better pictures. I was highly impressed.

There was no lag or slowdown in anything I tried. The battery life is way better than the S6 and with doze in Marshmellow, battery life is very solid. An even better trick to getting amazing battery life is with an app that removes all bloatware without having to root or trip knox.  I use this youtu.be/ct9K7iRifUg and my battery life is at least 25% better and longer in real world use.

Highly recommend this phone.","5.0 out of 5 stars"

If you live in the U.S., skip the unlocked international version and get the U.S. Version, it is a better phone. The international version uses Samsung's in house Exynos 8890 processor, which is a tad slower in CPU performance when compared to the U.S. versions Qualcomm Snapdragon 820. It also has issues with overheating. It is significantly slower in GPU performance, leading to less smooth animations and a few hiccups in everyday performance. In the past, the Exynos has been the faster of the two, but this year, the snapdragon 820 is a better processor. It is also optimized for use on American networks, whereas the Exynos version is optimized for European and other international networks. You don't save much money, and chances are, you won't switch networks, so it won't be a big deal. Also, carriers can usually unlock your phone. Also, I usually don't buy insurance on phones, but I made an exception for my S7, as replacing the screen or other internals is not as easy or cheap as with other phones. With most phones, when you crack your screen, you just replace the glass, however, with this particular Super AMOLED display, you must replace all of the components, not just the glass, and doing it yourself will most likely lead to more damage. I recommend Samsung's own protection plus plan, it is $129 (USD) for two years, with an inexpensive $79 deductible. With one claim, that is cheaper than square trade,many virtually every other protection plan out there. I would certainly give the US version 5 stars, for bringing back almost all features that were missing from the S6, and giving it a much larger battery and better camera. This phone is easily the most powerful phone on the market. It flies through daily tasks, and manages ram better than ever before. The battery life is phenomenal, easily an all day phone. I thought the always on display would be gimmicky and I would turn it off instantly, but I was pleasantly surprised with its efficiency and usefulness. It turns off when face down, or in your pocket, and automatically adjusts its brightness to match its surroundings. It is fantastic in my car mount, as i can easily check the time, without worrying about setting my radio's clock, or turning on my phone. It is not bright enough to disturb my sleep, and I can easily check the time in the middle of the night. Overall, a fantastic phone, I switched from iPhone, and will never go back. International version is a 4.5 star product, while the US version is 5 star, if you live in the US. I recommend this phone to literally anyone, it is simple enough for my grandma, and can be high,y customized if you desire. As easy as an iPhone, and as complex as an android, at the same time.

Whatever you do is fast and fluid. The camera is currently the best available on a smartphone. Fingerprints recognition add security. Size is perfect.

To Samsung:

I just would like Samsung to work on two sides:

1. Camera. Make it DSLR like. It is still far away from a good camera.

2. AI (Artificial Intelligence). This is hot and where the future is. S-Voice is still very primitive ""CALL ... JOHN ... SMITH"" ... ""WHAT ... WEATHER ... IS ... TOMORROW"". Annoying. Think about the following conversation with a Samsung smartphone: ""Samsung writes the following message via WhatsApp to John please ... John see you tonight at home at seven pm"" ... ""The message has been sent to John. Can I do something else for you?"" ... ""Oh yes .. can you please read me the last message from Susan please?"" ...  and so forth. Natural talking. Given a device which is fast and reliable, the AI will really make the difference in the future smartphone and customer preferences.","4.0 out of 5 stars"

The screen is big compared to my old iPhone 6. The AMOLED display makes images sharp and vibrant. Those were my first impressions of the phone. The last Samsung Galaxy product I bought was the Galaxy S4 a few years back, which had plenty of room for improvement. The S7 corrected past mistakes and excessive bloatware that was just unnecessary from previous generations. Most of the pre-installed apps that it does have meets my needs. They even took the time to organize them into their own folders just like I would most likely do.

Pros:
-Great display, in size and quality. I highly recommend playing with the Samsung Gear VR headset by Oculus. I have a review for that device on my public profile if you're looking for accessories but are unsure about them.
-Camera takes sharp, clear images. Almost as good as iPhone in my opinion.
-The phone itself loads any application efficiently with ease.
-The battery life, so far is pretty great. I used my Galaxy s7 and went through ten, 23 minute episodes of my favorite show on 45% battery life and had less than 15% left. Netflix is the heaviest strain on my battery life, but the Galaxy S7 handles it with ease. I bought the wireless charger which is a convenient device that deserves its own review. You can find that on my public profile.
-Expandable memory. Need I say more? I got a 128 GB micro SD card from that Wish.com app for a very cheap price and it works great. That brings the memory to my device up to 160 GB total. Yes, you read that right.

Cons:
If I compare speed to my older devices, such as an iPhone 6, the Galaxy S7 cannot keep up. While  it seems slower than other devices, the Galaxy S7 is still fast enough for my needs. I still give it five stars.
I'm still looking for other flaws, but again, these are my first impressions of the device.

I wasn't impressed with the Samsung Galaxy S4 to the point where I favored iPhone more for years. Samsung did great with this phone and made me not miss my iPhone.","5.0 out of 5 stars"

Another set of phones from manufacturers! I have been hooked onto get the latest phone every year syndrome and love reviewing specifics. Disclaimer, I love Android and have been using from very early days. Samsung Galaxy S7 still is evolutionary. If you have an older phone more than 2 years old, absolutely get this. So do check local specs. I played around with both S7 and S7 Edge for few days and my opinions are based on this. There are tons of reviews going into lot of details, so I am focused on few other aspects like what’s out there and how to compare specs. Overall S7 and S7 were very slick. If I have to make a choice between S7 and G5, I will slightly lean towards G5 but both are fantastic!

First Big Changes: microSD is back. And back with a vengeance 200 GB. I love it, and have been using it in my current LG as well.  Unfortunately, the battery is non-removable, has not been addressed. The only flagship to feature a removable battery so far this year is the LG G5. I know many of you loyal Samsung fans says BUMMER! I was a diehard fan of Samsung till S4, then I went to LG G2/G3. I was very curious to try out S7 as they are most talked about now. Why did I love it?! Screen is a beauty on S6 – Just Gorgeous. Just go to a retail store and feel it!

The Edge feature is still gimmicky. I think it will fold into regular phones at some point. It is certainly fancy and nice to show off, but I would rather buy an Android wear watch like Motorola 360 or Samsung Gear or LG R series.

IF YOU HAVE LAST YEAR model of any phone, PLEASE DON’T upgrade. Phones are becoming so standard and power packed it makes no sense to upgrade and waste money every year. I buy and sell so many phones as it is like a hobby for me, but I stick to one phone as primary for couple of years now. My main requirements are a 200 GB microSD, good screen, battery life and performance. I am trying hard to see if I can live without one.

In my opinion, following are key specs to consider when you buying a phone. Most of others are standard or does not matter at all. First size, weight and resolution are part of look and feel. RAM/CPU part of performance. External Storage is part of expandability. Camera is obvious! SAR (Specific Absorption Rating) is an often ignored, but I feel essential to making a buying choice. Manufacturers don’t advertise or mention SAR prominently.

Given the above key specs, my suggestion to my friends is to choose 2 or 3 KEY features you require (may be large screen size, maybe less weight, maybe more CPU power) and then start nailing down the phones. Definitely and definitely go to a phone or a big box store and feel the phone. Nothing replaces that. In the end you are using it for days and years, so the tactile feel is very important. I have used all these phones and at a high level they are all good. Few things here and there. And yes the cost. If you are in for a new smartphone and has a budget issue, GET LAST YEAR MODEL. They are as good as current year and probably half the cost! In this case I even suggest Galaxy S4 as it is an outstanding phone. It’s much cheaper and you will be happy!!

SCREEN SIZE/RESOLUTION:
I have experimented with many phone sizes and I have come to a conclusion 5” is the best form factor for me. Your mileage may vary, The display is absolutely stunning with a Quad HD screen and you have to see to feel it.

ANDROID UI:
S7 has Android OS v6.0 (Marshmallow)out of the box. User Interface has a flatter and simpler design, as is now the trend across the industry. Once you get used to user interface you get used to it. Android is very flexible and when I show my phone to a iPhone users they are usually in awe. I recently showed to my friends the details of processes. Battery usage like which process takes up more battery.

S-Health is a big deal, the app is beautiful and the heart rate and oxygen level measurements are great to keep track. I use Runtastic Pro and Nike+, but like the UI of S-Health too.

CAMERA:
Fantastic camera. One of the best smartphone cameras. Period.

PROCESSING POWER:
Don’t bother about it. For 99% of users, this is good enough. The phone has more processing power than the rocket that went to moon first time and much more. The games are very smooth, the UI is very smooth.

NFC Tags:
Wow, this is the most underrated in all reviews. I use AndroidPay constantly. I use it in WholeFoods and it is so easy. I have used at Walgreens too. Get bunch ( I mean around 10) of NFC Tags and use in bedrooms, offices, cars, living room and customize what your phone wants to do in those areas. For example, when I enter the car most often I use a) Navigation b) Listen to Podcasts. So I program my NFC tags accordingly using apps like Trigger and tap my phone to the NFC Tag and boom, phone does both.

BATTERY:
Do you really need to care for battery anymore. I don’t. Just use the phone. I have battery power banks with capacity as high as 30,000 mAh to 8000 mAh that I can charge virtually anywhere without a power supply. So this has become moot for me in past year. I would also suggest you get power banks and not really care of battery drainage. Use the phone and enjoy!

To give a sample, I tried following apps and they just worked awesome.

Amazon Mobile, Androidify, Aldiko Premium, Angry Birds (multiple themes), Asphalt 8, Box, Chrome, Android Pay, NAVIGON (from Garmin - offline maps), Nokia HERE Maps, Google Navigation/Earth/Maps, Google Drive, Ebay, Linkedin, Google Music, Tapatalk (awesome forum browsing app), Microsoft One Note (legacy docs, skydrive of 25 GB is good), Microsoft Office, (yes they have for Android!), Subsonic Music Streamer, TweetCaster Pro for Android (excellent twitter client), Twit.Tv, Trigger

"7","http://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Galaxy-Factory-Unlocked-Phone/product-reviews/B01CJU8FV4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_7?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=7&sortBy=recent","This being my upgrade from a Sony Xperia Advance (a mid-range smartphone from a few years ago, which was also waterproof), it's perhaps not surprising that I am thoroughly impressed by this device. I had looked at the S6 last year, but it wasn't enough to make me want to buy, in particular given the lack of waterproofing, the lack of expandable storage, and the good but not mind-blowing camera. Samsung has made the S7 everything I had been dreaming of but didn't see in the S6, and I just couldn't say no. On paper, the S7 is my perfect phone.

And it turns out it's my perfect phone in practice too.

The camera, which was the main selling point for me, lives up to the claims. I have been getting great indoor (and outdoor) shots of my 5-year old in action. With my old phone, that was completely impossible since it would take at least 10 seconds to open the camera app and focus. With the S7, I can go from picking up the locked phone to capturing a perfectly focused image in 3 seconds (I caught my son in mid-air as he jumped off a ramp on his scooter). And the colors are almost always very close to what I perceive with my eye, even in some unusual lighting (like midnight in the arctic in spring, or mixed fluorescent light/sunlight in my living room).

The screen is gorgeous as everyone knows. Its resolution is riDONKulous.

The phone is a good size for me (good balance between being comfortable in the hand, fitting in the pocket, and having a usefully sized screen). I got a slim Spigen Rugged Armor case for it, which makes me feel much more confident in gripping it (in a way, the phone itself is too thin and smooth and glass), and gives the phone a slightly different but still cool look.

Of course, it's expensive. But you're really getting a phone, a palm-top computer (which is as fast as any smartphone out there and therefore fast enough to make any Android 3D game or other app run smoothly), an e-reader, and a better-than-point-and-shoot camera all in one.

I definitely recommend this device.","5.0 out of 5 stars"

I was lucky to get 6 hours out of them before I had to recharge.
Having said that, I will say they were very good in the bright sunlight and the processor was faster than my S4 but I still opted to go back to my S4 due to the battery lasting all day.  I could just set the S7 on my desk and watch the battery power drain out of it without even using it.  I also tried the power saving mode with no noticeable difference.  The phones also generated a lot of heat which I assume was causing the battery drain.  Costco did give two extra large batteries for the phones as if they knew there was a power drain problem.  Costco/Verizon was very good at returning them.  I would probably upgrade to the S7 if the battery life can be solved.  For now I will stick with my old S4 which functions just fine.","2.0 out of 5 stars"

What a fantastic phone!  The camera itself leaves my Galaxy S5 (and any model iPhone) in the dust.  I will leave the details to other reviewers, but just a couple of comments on the Dual-SIM version which I bought:

(a)  It doesn't say you have to, but I powered off the phone before putting SIMs in.  Why take a chance?
(b)  Both SIM's sit in the same tray, and you have to be careful that SIM 2 is still seated all the way as you push the tray back in.  Any resistance, STOP, and check that everything is seated.  By the way, an important note:  You may NOT have a second SIM and a microSD card in the phone at the same time - they use the same slot!  I don't care about this (yet), as 32GB should be enough memory, but this gave me pause.
(c)  You can select the default SIM to use separately for each important function: outbound Voice and Text, and data.  This is a nice feature, but it's still possible to override these selections when making an outbound call, so you can get mixed up.  There is also an on/off function for each SIM which prevents this, as a safety in preventing very high roaming charges!

If I had it to do over again, I wouldn't get the silver color.  Although it still looks classy, it also looks like a run-of-the-mill iPhone 6 haha.  I liked the electric blue color on my S5 better (not available on the S7, as far as I know) - just had more of a wow factor.","5.0 out of 5 stars"

The box had been opened and the phone had some traces of fingertips. However, it doesn't look like the phone has ever been used. It still had the protective plastic layers and all the contents in the box were wraped and sealed. The charger is from the UK but a UK-US adapter was included in the box. So far the phone works great and it's beautiful. Compared to what I'd have spent on this phone if I'd bought it from a US carrier I have saved around 100 $. The only thing I didn't like is that the seal was broken. I would like to know why. Overall I am satisfied with this purchase.

Out of Black, white , Gold and Silver I chose the gold one. No doubt Samsung has again shown its creativity in its new launch Galaxy S7.

I will start with not so impressive points of this new tech wonder-
1) Similar look to S6- It looks so similar to older version S6 in design. At least a new version should have differences from its predecessors not only by features but also by look. Both of them are same by size, look , height , width. Only slight differences are there by look. S6 is more flat at the back whereas S7 has curved panel.
The rear camera in s6 sticks out a bit whereas in S7 the camera is more flat.
2) No Type c USB - I will miss my nexus Type c usb connector in S7 which I really enjoy in my google nexus 5X. S again I will be missing my fast charging here which is most needed when you are in a hurry and want to get your phone atleast half charged within a couple of minutes.
3) No 3D touch- I love 3D touch of my iPhone 6S plus which I will be missing in this S7.

Now the best and most impressive sides of S7 are -
1) Better camera than S6-  In spite of the significant megapixel difference in camera between S6 and S7 ( S6 has 16 MP rear camera where as S7 has 12 mp rear camera ) I would say the camera is much better than S6 . Pictures comes solid in S7 and you will not have a chance to think about the megapixel difference.
2) Waterproof phone- Yeah, Samsung has created the wonder fully waterproof which is savior to those worries if your phone accidentally gets dropped in water.
3) Better battery performance - Combo of 3000 mah battery and android marshmallow featuring long lasting battery will make S7 horse of a long race.
4) Micro SD card support- It supports Micro SD card which is a win win over S6.

I am using this phone and have no complaints still now and pretty happy with my golden S7.","5.0 out of 5 stars"

Another set of phones from manufacturers! I have been hooked onto get the latest phone every year syndrome and love reviewing specifics. Disclaimer, I love Android and have been using from very early days. Samsung Galaxy S7 still is evolutionary. If you have an older phone more than 2 years old, absolutely get this. So do check local specs. I played around with both S7 and S7 Edge for few days and my opinions are based on this. There are tons of reviews going into lot of details, so I am focused on few other aspects like what’s out there and how to compare specs. Overall S7 and S7 were very slick. If I have to make a choice between S7 and G5, I will slightly lean towards G5 but both are fantastic!

First Big Changes: microSD is back. And back with a vengeance 200 GB. I love it, and have been using it in my current LG as well.  Unfortunately, the battery is non-removable, has not been addressed. The only flagship to feature a removable battery so far this year is the LG G5. I know many of you loyal Samsung fans says BUMMER! I was a diehard fan of Samsung till S4, then I went to LG G2/G3. I was very curious to try out S7 as they are most talked about now. Why did I love it?! Screen is a beauty on S6 – Just Gorgeous. Just go to a retail store and feel it!

The Edge feature is still gimmicky. I think it will fold into regular phones at some point. It is certainly fancy and nice to show off, but I would rather buy an Android wear watch like Motorola 360 or Samsung Gear or LG R series.

IF YOU HAVE LAST YEAR model of any phone, PLEASE DON’T upgrade. Phones are becoming so standard and power packed it makes no sense to upgrade and waste money every year. I buy and sell so many phones as it is like a hobby for me, but I stick to one phone as primary for couple of years now. My main requirements are a 200 GB microSD, good screen, battery life and performance. I am trying hard to see if I can live without one.

In my opinion, following are key specs to consider when you buying a phone. Most of others are standard or does not matter at all. First size, weight and resolution are part of look and feel. RAM/CPU part of performance. External Storage is part of expandability. Camera is obvious! SAR (Specific Absorption Rating) is an often ignored, but I feel essential to making a buying choice. Manufacturers don’t advertise or mention SAR prominently.

phone parameters: {size, weight, resolution, ppi, RAM, ext Storage, camera, CPU, USA SAR rating}

Given the above key specs, my suggestion to my friends is to choose 2 or 3 KEY features you require (may be large screen size, maybe less weight, maybe more CPU power) and then start nailing down the phones. Definitely and definitely go to a phone or a big box store and feel the phone. Nothing replaces that. In the end you are using it for days and years, so the tactile feel is very important. I have used all these phones and at a high level they are all good. Few things here and there. And yes the cost. If you are in for a new smartphone and has a budget issue, GET LAST YEAR MODEL. They are as good as current year and probably half the cost! In this case I even suggest Galaxy S4 as it is an outstanding phone. It’s much cheaper and you will be happy!!

SCREEN SIZE/RESOLUTION:
I have experimented with many phone sizes and I have come to a conclusion 5” is the best form factor for me. Your mileage may vary, The display is absolutely stunning with a Quad HD screen and you have to see to feel it.

ANDROID UI:
S7 has Android OS v6.0 (Marshmallow)out of the box. User Interface has a flatter and simpler design, as is now the trend across the industry. Once you get used to user interface you get used to it. Android is very flexible and when I show my phone to a iPhone users they are usually in awe. I recently showed to my friends the details of processes. Battery usage like which process takes up more battery.

S-Health is a big deal, the app is beautiful and the heart rate and oxygen level measurements are great to keep track. I use Runtastic Pro and Nike+, but like the UI of S-Health too.

CAMERA:
Fantastic camera. One of the best smartphone cameras. Period.

PROCESSING POWER:
Don’t bother about it. For 99% of users, this is good enough. The phone has more processing power than the rocket that went to moon first time and much more. The games are very smooth, the UI is very smooth.

NFC Tags:
Wow, this is the most underrated in all reviews. I use AndroidPay constantly. I use it in WholeFoods and it is so easy. I have used at Walgreens too. Get bunch ( I mean around 10) of NFC Tags and use in bedrooms, offices, cars, living room and customize what your phone wants to do in those areas. For example, when I enter the car most often I use a) Navigation b) Listen to Podcasts. So I program my NFC tags accordingly using apps like Trigger and tap my phone to the NFC Tag and boom, phone does both.

BATTERY:
Do you really need to care for battery anymore. I don’t. Just use the phone. I have battery power banks with capacity as high as 30,000 mAh to 8000 mAh that I can charge virtually anywhere without a power supply. So this has become moot for me in past year. I would also suggest you get power banks and not really care of battery drainage. Use the phone and enjoy!

To give a sample, I tried following apps and they just worked awesome.

Amazon Mobile, Androidify, Aldiko Premium, Angry Birds (multiple themes), Asphalt 8, Box, Chrome, Android Pay, NAVIGON (from Garmin - offline maps), Nokia HERE Maps, Google Navigation/Earth/Maps, Google Drive, Ebay, Linkedin, Google Music, Tapatalk (awesome forum browsing app), Microsoft One Note (legacy docs, skydrive of 25 GB is good), Microsoft Office, (yes they have for Android!), Subsonic Music Streamer, TweetCaster Pro for Android (excellent twitter client), Twit.Tv, Trigger

Ask questions. I will be glad to answer any questions within 24 hours.","5.0 out of 5 stars"

Where do I start. Excellent smartphone with 4GB of ram, sleek and slim metal body, 12-mp camera (excellent in low light), 32GB storage and a Quad HD display. This stunning device is worth the price. The Samsung Galaxy S7 is not just another regular smartphone, it is a powerful gaming machine. With the new Mali-T880 MP12 GPU, console-type games can run without any lag on the device without draining the battery. I forgot to mention the 3000mAh battery which is a big step up from the S6's battery. The Galaxy S7 is much more power efficient than the S6 and the battery can last a long time with the Ultra Power Saving Mode. It is also full ip68 waterproof meaning that it can be underwater 1.5m depth for 30-minutes and come out perfect. Unlike the Galaxy S6, the S7 has expandable storage. You can insert a micro-sd card up with a maximum of 200gb of capacity. That will solve the problem that everyone has, the problem of low storage available.

I received it on the March 1st, ahead of the official launch. As soon as it came in, I put my old phone down (Samsung Note Edge) and started using my new gadget.

Right out of the box, the first think I notices was how thin it was. The camera bump is almost non existent. It may also be worth mentioning I got the Titanium Silver, although it has a sort of gold tint to it. The body feels solid and very well built. The four buttons (Home, Power, volume up and down) are well fitting and there is little wiggling.

What we don't see is the dust and water resistant properties, and frankly, I do not want to test it out.

The speaker, voice hole, power/usb port. and headphone jack are all on the bottom of the phone. At the top is another microphone hole, and the sim card/storage card slot.

This is preference, but I dislike having my earphone jacks on the bottom of the phone. Also, the major selling point of this phone, the edge's, are all but lost in the sleek design. Unlike the Note Edge, the edge just seems too narrow and thin, making it more of a visual appeal rather than an actual useful tool. The Note Edge had a sharper slop and large edge screen for actual apps, short cuts, ect. For the S7 Edge, you have to bring out the modified ""edge screen"", and honestly, even the S7 non-edge can do same thing. Overall, getting the S7 Edge over the S7 non-edge is just the size of the screen.

The Home button has a finger scanner in it, so when you register a passcode, you can assign your finger print as well to unlock faster. So far it works very well.

The camera quality is excellent. The best I have seen on a phone. This comparing to the Note Edge's 16MP and Moto Pure's 21MP. MP now are more for numbers and touting, but S7 Edge proves that a ""lower"" MP count of 12 can surpass the quality of higher MP cameras. The pictures in low light, action shots, close ups, bright lights, ect are fast and accurate. I have yet to encounter much blur. This is a huge leap from the past Samsung cameras that have been plagued with zooming and focusing issues.

The OS. With the power behind this phone, and 4 GB of ram, this thing flies. I spent so time removing the bloatware that Samsung packs on it. The enhanced edge menu is not as good as the standard Note Edge's menu. Unfortunately, either the phone hardware or the Marshmallow Android operating system is having some issues.

Apps on the phone work good about 80% of the time. The other 20% I have had issues with the app just closing all together. This is probably due to the ""newish"" Android OS that comes installed, so hopefully it gets patched soon.

The screen is extra sensitive, even after calibration. I scroll, and am very careful not to move my finger too fast or double tap, but the phone 30-40% of the time registers it as a tap. Also, wifi cuts in and out. I have switched routers, reset phone, ect, but the wifi drops a few times an hour. Mostly when the phone screen turns off.

The screen picture is beautiful. can't say much more than that. Can't wait to try with the Gear VR.
Finally, call quality. For me, the speaker is not very loud, both on speaker phone mode and off. Sound on the other end of the call seems adequate, so no complaints there.

In summary, the phone is pretty dang good. The now useless edge screen, wifi issues, screen sensitivity issues, and app issues are the reasons why the phone does not get a perfect score.","4.0 out of 5 stars"

So just a few comments.
1.  Do charge the battery before first use. And, yes, charging is fast.
2.  This phone takes a NANO sim card.  That's smaller than my prior sim, so necessitated a trip into a local AT&T store for a new sim.  Which was relatively quick, after a wait, and the phone, yes, unlocked phone, readily worked fine.
3.  Prior to heading into AT&T, though, I was able to complete most of the initial phone set up using my local Wi-Fi connection.  Neat.  But I did notice that the phone felt a bit warm during this process.  I now have the phone in a case, and no longer feels warm, though that could be somewhat due to the case.  But after initial, I didn't really notice my warmth from the phone either.
4.  Battery remaining % is displayed right on the lock screen.  Nice.  But battery life does seem to fall off fairly quickly.  But will let this battery discharge and recharge a few times, and then see where things stand.
5.  My granddaughter asked why I got a smaller phone, but I'm hoping that with this higher resolution to not miss my former larger phone.  Time will tell.
6.  My biggest con?  The screen covering the speaker located on the bottom edge is applied at an angle and appears damaged and crunched.  Speaker is fine, best that I can tell, and so I am not interested in returning for a small cosmetic.  Still, I'd have preferred that QC had caught.  So dinging one star.","4.0 out of 5 stars"

By ordering through a carrier the price was a few hundred dollars cheaper than what the unlocked version costs on amazon. Out of the box you get the phone itself, a charging cable, headphone earbuds, a usb connector (to connect 2 phones together), and a tool to open the sd card tray. Its easy to not see the small metal sd card tray tool, so be careful. I am switching from a Samsung S4 and the quality of this phones build is noticable. The S4 was made of plastic and felt cheap, the S7 is glass front, glass back and metal sides and feels sleeker and sturdier. I was concerned that the back was made of glass but the guy at the verizon store says they get very few complaints of the back shattering. I rarely drop my phone so I'm not worried. You can insert a removable SD card into a tray at the top of the device. you stick the SD card tool into a little hole at the top and a tray pops out. If you pull the entire tray out the SIM card can fall out so be careful. This phone is physically bigger than my S4 (length) but slightly thinner.

Setup was a breeze although it took some time. I had to log into verizonwireless website find the right links and activate the phone from the website. If you by from a physical location they will set it up for you. Most of my apps, pics, and settings transferred over automatically.

There is a fingerprint scanner in the home screen button, but you can choose other security options like pattern or pin if you so choose. Speakers are on the bottom near the usb input and headphone jack, so that means if phone is lying face up you can still hear from the speakers (S4 speakers were on back which meant sound could get muffled when laying the phone down or if hand is covering back). not a fan of headphone jack on bottom but thats a minor annoyance. Screen is bright and looks great. Camera is fewer MP than the S6 but this camera supposedly lets in more light. All the pictures I took look great.

The phone moves very fast. There is no lag opening apps. For all of you who are dropping your phones in the toilet or in your beer, this phone is waterproof! SAMSUNG PAY! So this was a surprise to me, Samsung Pay is awesome. The Galaxy S7 supports MST which simulates the magnetic stripe on your credit card which means you can use Samsung Pay anywhere that has a credit card machine. This is better than Android pay and Apple Pay which use NFC and can only be used at a small number of retailers.

So first annoying thing I noticed was Verizon and Samsung put a bunch of their own apps on the phone. I was confused on how I should be sending text messages because there was a Google, Verizon and samsung messaging app! I just want one app to text, I dont need 3. Also the phone gets noticeably warm with use. i'm guessing this may partially be due to the fact that it has been downloading pics, contacts, apps and everything from the cloud. This is a bit surprising to me since this phone is supposed to have liquid cooling. If I were playing a game on the phone it would probably get pretty hot.

So Pro/Con time:
Pros:
Waterproof
Removable Storage (phones without this just try to charge you more for storage, its cheap to buy SD cards)
Camera (lower MP, but it lets in more light, pics look noticeably better)
Bigger battery (longer battery life and fast charging, also able to charge wireless)
Faster (no lag opening apps, browsing web is fast)
Android Marshmallow

Cons:
Bloatware (came pre loaded with 7 samsung apps, 8 verizon apps, not to mention 10 google apps but i actually use the google ones)
Glass back attracts fingerprints
No USB type C - small annoyance. Things are moving to type C and its nice that C fits both ways, but at same time micro USB is ubiquitous so I can use 1000 different micro USB chargers I have lying around
Crashes - So far the phone has crashed at least once per day. and the fingerprint sensor has stopped working a few times

SHOULD YOU BUY?
If you have S4 or older - This is a no brainer upgrade right away
If you have an S5 - I would upgrade. They brought back the waterproof, you have the removable SD card slot, bigger processor bigger battery
If you have the S6 - I probably wouldn't upgrade. Yes they brought back features that weren't on the S6 but I'm not sure that's worth spending the money to upgrade from the S6 after only a year. S6 is still a good phone.
Wait for LG G5? - This is an interesting debate. The G5 has more unique features like modular accessories to add to bottom of the phone. LG ditched the leather customizable back for an all aluminum body so its now closer to Iphone in styling. The G5 does not have wireless charging or samsung pay (just android pay). Its really a toss up on which of these two you should get","5.0 out of 5 stars"

Some genius at samsung decides its a good idea to make 1 single slot for both sim and micro sd. It has a supplied tray for both cards to be placed in, and then tray must go into phone, however, my sim card didnt fit in the tray,, but it fit perfectly in the phone without it and the phone registers the sim, and i can use it properly, but as it turns out i cant insert micro sd card because the sim card is now jammed.

The tmobile store employees acknowledges this problem and as it turns out that 1 store already had ""a bunch"" of people already with same issue, they r forcing people to file insurance claims, pay deductibles and labelling physicsl damage to the phones. I called customer care and that 1 rep i spoke with confirmed hes had a lot of calls about this issue and also tried to claim physicsl dsmage, i explained phone works perfectly fine i can make calls and texts as it is registering sim card, anyways long story short they allowed me to return it under buyers remorse and once refunded i will place another order.

For employees who get trained its a no brainer but for average customers like me who have had previous samsung phones i thought it would be the same to where u insert microsd and it pops right out, however once sim is in u realize it will not come back out, it ejects partially but its still deep in the phone and unable to come out.

Some dude at samsung should get demoted i understand its to try n save space sine it has no removable battery but possibly hundreds if not thousands of people r getting screwed, 1 single store alone had and i quote "" a bunch"" of,people with same issue and the 1 rep also on the phone says he has gotten a lot of calls about it.","1.0 out of 5 stars"

It is beautiful, it is ""edgey,"" and it is FAST!. Although I love the curves and the way it feels in my hand, it did attract fingerprints, so I placed a Skinomi screen cover (great cover, BTW, and easy to install) AND a cover (currently using Samsung clear black S view case) to limit fingerprints and prevent damage to this gorgeous phone. Can't believe how long it lasts on 1 battery charge. I am currently using Samsung stand fast charger, and I've got to say, it is really speedy! At night, I place it on my Tylt Vu, and it charges while I sleep, then shuts off so no overcharge. The phone is lightning fast and handles everything I've thrown at it. I LOVE the availability of THEMES, many of which are free, and the remainder are really inexpensive--nice way to personalize the phone! This was an upgrade from a Galaxy S5--I skipped the S6--love the S7E return to additional storage via micro SD card (up to 200 GB!) and water-resistance. Thought I'd miss the replaceable battery the S% had, but this battery is a BEAST and haven't missed replaceable at all. The Edge is a nice feature--still learning how to best utilize it.

The only caveats of having a glass back are the amount of fingerprints the S7 picks up, and also how slippery the device is. While it is less slippery in-hand than the S6 it is still a small nuisance that was worth mentioning. If you can live with those two issues, the design of the S7 is superb. Along with the glass back, throw in the metal rails, and perfectly placed power and volume buttons, and the S7 feels great in-hand. While on the subject of the buttons, I did quickly want to mention how nice they are. Not only are they placed perfectly on each side, but they’re also extremely tactile and easy to press. On the bottom of the S7 are the headphone jack, micro-usb cable, microphone, and speaker. That speaker has been making headlines because of how poor it sounds, but for me it isn’t a deal breaker considering the trade of dust and water resistance. Moving on to the front side of the device, you’re greeted with the best display on the market, a 5.1 inch quad-hd Super Amoled display. The colors here are extremely vibrant, with deep blacks as Samsung displays usually are. The colors aren’t very accurate, but what can you expect from Samsung right? Now along with a normal display, Samsung included an always on display that shows the date, time as well as your battery percentage. Below the display is the capacitive buttons along with the button that doubles as both a home button and fingerprint sensor. In my time with the S7, the fingerprint scanner was pretty good. It worked the first time about 85 to 90 percent of the time, but on occasion there was the annoying,”no match.”Overall, Samsung really nailed the design aspect of the S7, with the only real downsides coming with the glass back, but it still isn’t too much of a big deal.

Specs Wise, in the States the S7 is packing a beefy octa core Snapdragon 820 with the Adreno 530 GPU and 4 gigs of ram. All these top of the line specs results in superb day to day performance. Sure, there were a few small hiccups here and there, but that’s to be expected with any device you’re getting. With all these high end specs, you would expect the battery life to be subpar right. But this might be where the S7 most surprised me. I got a solid 4 to 4 and half hours of on screen time even with heavy usage and the phone always searching for signal on AT&T’s network.

On the software side of things, the S7 is rocking the latest Android 6.0 Marshmallow. Now on previous versions of Touchwiz, there wasn’t much you could do about the amount of bloat there was and how far it strayed from Stock android. However, this time around, Samsung included a theme store where you could download stock android themes to make the S7’s software more like how Google intended for android to be. So while even with the Stock theme the S7 won’t be an exact replica of stock android, it still does give it a more stock feel than with the default theme. Sure while the S7’s software still isn’t the best, it is a lot better than previous generations of Touchwiz.

The camera on the back is 12 megapixel sensor with an aperture of f1.7 and OIS on board with the front facing camera being a 5 megapixel sensor. While there was initially a big fuss made about the reduction of pixels, the benefit is that the pixel size is even larger than before which results in even better images. The stock app is very similar to the iPhone with a simple and easy to navigate interface. Even with it’s simplicity, Samsung still managed to pack in modes like Pro mode, slow motion, hyperlapse and even a live broadcasting mode. Now the pictures that end up coming from this camera are stunning! Even in auto mode, they come out nice and crisp with good saturation and contrast. The auto HDR also does a great job. Also, the sharpening effect from last year has been slightly reduced, but it is still noticeable.","5.0 out of 5 stars"

I typically will use 1 1/2 full charges everday (sometimes 2), so the ability to carry an extra battery with me and to pop in when needed is essential for me.  The inability to change out the battery on this phone makes it a deal breaker for me.

This is truely sad for me because I love Samsung phones (that's why 4 stars), and I am now ready to upgrade my phone.  I would suggest to Samsung that the company rethink the decision to lock users out of the battery compartment.

I came from the Sony Xperia Z5 Compact, which I loved until their version of Android took a Marshmallow-sized dump and massively glitched out, becoming unusable. Sony's ""XPERIA™ Support"" was of absolutely no help in this matter. Before Xperia, I owned the Sony Z3 Compact and the Samsung Galaxy S2. Definitely glad I switched back to Samsung! The grass is NOT greener on the other side, believe me!

I'll take Samsung's 12MP over Sony's 23MP any day. Far superior in the areas of auto-focus, low-light, and manual parameters. The Sony Z5 Compact can record 4K video as well, but not without tons of initial lag and post lag (storage, encapsulation). The Samsung S7 is relatively quick with 4K on the initial and reasonable with the post (when you finish recording).

And the phone volume is LOUD. Usable, in fact. Sony's Z5 Compact was disappointingly quiet.

The Samsung Galaxy S7 is an amazing piece of technology. Samsung stuck with the glossy, glassy design, while bringing back the stuff we loved. Let’s start with the elephant in the room, SD card EXPANSION/ This was a huge difference from Apples and Galaxies. So why on Earth did they ditch storage expansion, I don’t know. But it’s back! Not only that, but it fits well with the SIM card. Another thing they brought back to the S7, waterproof! Admittedly, the S6 was really good against water, but it’s nice to know the S7 can official survive and a few meters of water. The phone is faster than ever, and Android Marshmallow is so clean. They improved TouchWiz UI; now it’s not that ugly lime and blue color. The phone in the hand is comfortable, unlike the sharp edges of the S6 and S6 edge. Camera is very responsive and takes the best low light photos I’ve ever seen. The 12 Megapixel camera, seems low in terms as pixels, but uses an amazing technology called Dual Pixel Autofocus. Overall:
Pros:
-Better Battery Life (3000 mAh)
-Faster (Exynos 8890)
-Great Camera (12 MP)
-Storage Expansion
-Waterproof

Cons:
-Slippery in hands

In conclusion, if you like the S6’s design and wished it had more “Android” features, this is the perfect phone. Samsung improved on everything and Galaxy lovers can’t be happier. Samsung listened to it’s audience and did everything right! If you’re coming from an Apple device, no time would be better to switch!","5.0 out of 5 stars"

I would say this phone is the maximum screen size for one-handed use.  With small hands, I was pressing the touch sensitive buttons to the left and right of the home button all the time.  I purchased a cheap case to provide a lip for my hand to rest which solves that problem.

One thing that I LOVE is the camera.  This thing shoots in 4K video, and the image quality is far beyond any other phone.  It lets you adjust iso, shutter speed, and exposure which are features usually found in DSLR cameras.

My only criticism is the lack of Adoptable Storage. I really want this feature. Or think I do. 32GB is not enough memory and most of my apps do not transfer to the SD card. I've heard both that Adoptable Storage fixes this and that it doesn't. I couldn't tell you which is correct since I don't have it.

But, note this is still a five star review. Why's that? Awesome screen, good battery life, pretty good GPS, fast processor, perfectly sized phone - although hard to grip without a case, which is why I recommend a RhinoShield Crash Guard.

I pretty much only care about maps, news and emails, but the voice quality on this phone is outstanding when you get to connect to another HD Voice device.

I use AllTrails and PDF Maps (with Tom Harrison maps) for hiking. Both work awesome on this phone. The phone's GPS is definitely not as good as my dedicated Garmin eTrex 30 GPS, but it is probably better than my original black and white eTrex Vista and definitely better than my Nuvi 3490. The battery drains fast while I'm recording a track with the phone, but it has had more than enough juice for 12 mile hikes. You must record tracks if you want the GPS to be useful while hiking as getting a fix at the application takes too long if you aren't recording the track. Heavily forested areas cause grief for the phone's GPS whereas my eTrex 30 has no problem at all. The eTrex 30 will also last more than 24 hours while recording everything. However, the phone utterly blows away the eTrex 30 for map quality - and yes, I bought TOPO maps for the eTrex 30. I mean, if I know I'm not going to be in a heavily forested area, and that I'm not going to be out all day, then I always prefer this phone over the eTrex 30. The maps are that much better and the phone's display obviously trounces the eTrex 30's display. And the phone is waterproof just like the eTrex 30!

My Canon PowerShot S120 is very obviously the better camera... for still shots. You can see the difference right away if you have an eye for this stuff. I think the phone's main problem is image processing more than the actual sensor. The other thing is there is no optical zoom on the phone obviously. However, the phone does have optical image stabilization and it is pretty good. In a twist, the phone is light years ahead of the S120 for video. I shoot in UHD 30fps (not the default) and the video is amazing. The file size, though, does get to be enormous. Better have a high capacity SD card in there if you do a lot of video with UHD. All this said, the still shots with the phone are very good and are probably better than a lot of lower priced point and shoot cameras. So, when I'm not on vacation or doing something that I really want to get the best shots with, I prefer the phone since it is small and easy to carry. Well, I always have the thing on me, don't I?

I had resisted getting a smartphone, because the data costs weren't worth it to me. I do not care about social media, texting, or any of that garbage. I do care a lot about maps, photos and videos since I like to do things in real life. This is the first smartphone that really fit the bill for all of this. It's like it was made just for me. It just needs Adoptable Storage. Please, Samsung/T-Mobile, enable that in an update.","5.0 out of 5 stars"

I got this yesterday 3 days early from Sprint and have been using it heavily since. I'm very happy with the functionality, it's fast, UI is great and Android Marshmallow is absolutely amazing.

Overall I am very impressed so far and I like it far better than my friend's Galaxy S6 or my dad's S5. I was worried about switching away from HTC because I loved my HTC's metal frame but this is much sturdier than I was expecting and feels very solid in your hand. The UI's have their differences (TouchWiz vs HTC Sense) but overall quite similar and not too difficult to transition.

The ""Always On"" display is a very simple but amazing feature and bringing back water resistance and expandable memory is what made me switch to the GS7. Fingerprint reader is better than any other phone one I've used and extremely quick. Photos (front and rear camera) come out clean and the shutter is very quick. Have yet to test it in low light but I will be updating this review with more information when I get to testing more features. Being able to split screen apps is quite wonderful and I'm using it more than I would have expected myself to. I got home last night after using it down to about 40% battery life and plugging into the normal MicroUSB charger it went from 40%-70% in about 30 minutes so it does charge very quickly. I have yet to get a wireless QI charger yet but plan to soon.

My only gripe so far is battery life. I typically use my phone somewhat heavily and I took it off the charger this morning at 8am. It is now 2pm and I'm at 56%. It's not quite as good as I was expecting but I'm sure as I manage it more and get my task killer apps installed but when I'm getting barely more than the 2 year old HTC One M8 I traded in for this I guess I was somewhat shocked.

All in all I'm very happy so far. I'll update this review as I keep using it more and more and I'm sure battery life will increase as I manage the apps and stop playing with it as often as I have been (pretty much non stop for the last 16 hours).","5.0 out of 5 stars"

This phone is exactly as marketed.
Pros:
- Its fast, It will run many processes in the background without ever bogging down ( improvement over my S5)
- Its got a good camera for the 99% of us who are not professional photographers.
- Display is clear and high def.
- It's slightly smaller than my S5. I actually like this.
- They brought back the SD card slot (one reason I didn't get the S6)
- To the fellow that complained about dropping it from over a foot and it breaking..... buy a case... its what people do with a $700 phone.

Cons:
- Battery life is still good, but not as good as my S5... I will play with it all day and it will still have about 40% left as opposed to 60% with my older one.
- Headphone jack on the bottom of phone... personal preference I suppose, but I liked it on the top.
- Still has the more complicated menu settings of android phones... Ex: Might take you a few minutes to find the right tab to rename your phone.
- Samsungs ""SmartSwitch"" isn't great when transferring files to your new phone. Try to store as much as you can on your old SD card before moving things or you might lose some of those valued pictures or documents.","5.0 out of 5 stars"

The glass back is nonsense. It might look nice, but who cares how it looks if it will be either broken or covered by a protective case?

Other thoughts: The power and volume down buttons stopped working right away. Apparently there is a workaround to make them work. Still not acceptable for a flagship phone.

This phone was everything I could have asked for. I always had this predisposition that the Samsung phones were made with lower quality materials, but I was dead wrong. This phone is Beautiful! The materials they put into it are top notch and in my personal opinion this device looks and feels much better than the iPhones!

When I first got I was worried because I was switching from Apple to Android, which can be a pretty daunting change. BUT the transition did not seem to take long at all. I got into the phone pretty quickly and was doing my normal daily tasks in no time.

It is sad that I had to give up FaceTime but I feel like it was worth it and my friends quickly adapted and started calling me on Skype or Oovoo instead.

Unlike the name says, this phone did actually come with some type of warranty I believe. On the box there was a ""24 month warranty"" sticker,.. So I am assuming that means I have a warranty!

I also was curious to see which phone is faster (the iPhone 6s Plus vs the Samsung Galaxy S7) so I ran a few easy tests. In getting into apps, the Samsung got in just a hair faster. In loading webpages, the Samsung again beat the iPhone just by a hair.

The camera on the Samsung is by far the superior camera when there is ample amount of lighting but in low light, I would give it to the iPhone. The front-facing camera, works the same way. In low light the iPhone wins, but with enough light, the Samsung does better.

There are many really cool customization options on the Android software that you would have to jailbreak your iPhone to do, and with the type of person I am I feel like the Android software works better for me. On the other hand, Android may be more confusing to use. Things are not always quite right there where you want them to be and you have have to search for them. BUT Android helps you out with this with search bars when they are convenient.

Overall this device is everything I could have asked for. I really enjoy it and I hope I can continue enjoying it for as long as possibly","5.0 out of 5 stars"

"","","It seems that most of these unlocked international version phones are unlocked by the sellers themselves, who break the phone's box seal, open the box, and unlock the phones themselves (note that Samsung says ""do not accept if seal is broken""). Hence, technically, most of these unlocked international version phones are not really new. I bought a lot of Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge phones from Amazon, and most (not all) had the seal broken.

On the phone itself, this is the best phone I have ever tried. Slick, light, balanced, fantastic screen, fast, water proof, and so on .... its only caveat (and an important one) is the lack of removable battery (Samsung lost the removable batter starting with the S6). I like this phone much better than the Edge. The S7 Edge has a bigger screen, but the resolution is the same as with the S7, and its edges are highly annoying, making one touch them by mistake constantly. Furthermore, the Edge's edges make it very difficult to properly protect the phone with a case - not a problem with the regular S7.

Finally, the only difference between the G930F (single sim version) and the G930FD (dual sim version) is that in the latter the slot where the micro card goes is also enabled to accept a second sim card, which is recognized by the device's OS.","3.0 out of 5 stars"
"","","The packaging was great, brand new phone. The phone works great! Definitely an upgrade from the HTC One M9 that I had. The camera takes super great pictures and the display on the phone is A+. I could not recommend this phone more! It does require a sim card, so if you have AT&T it'll work just fine. The battery is also an upgrade from my HTC! My HTC would take long to charge and died quickly. This Galaxy S7 lasts me the whole day and charges very fast. Overall a great phone, definitely should by!","5.0 out of 5 stars"

After 2 hours being bounced around among AT&T, Samsung, and Microsoft (not to mention the hours I spent trying on my own to synchronize my Outlook data with the phone), the answer, apparently, is that it is a ""known issue"" that a Galaxy S7 cannot be synchronized with Outlook.  Seriously.
What it will do, instead of synchronizing, is duplicate entries between the computer and the phone.  So, if you had a haircut set for Wednesday, synchronized that with Outlook today, then moved that appointment to Friday on your Outlook calendar on the computer, guess what?  Next time you synchronize, your Galaxy S7 and Outlook will show haircut appointments on Wednesday AND Friday.
It gets worse.  If you didn't move the appointment, after synchronizing, you will show two identical entries for that haircut on Wednesday.
So, basically, you can't use this phone for calendar and contacts.  Or, at least, that's the answer after 2 hours of having the technical support people remotely control the phone.","1.0 out of 5 stars"

For apps this makes sense, for phone numbers this is just thoughtless user interface design. Why is there no easy way to tell the phone to use the SD Card for apps?

Okay, so after all of my ranting of my concern re: this phone and not being sure if I was going to get it, God told me this is the phone He wants for me, so I put aside my inhibitions and went ahead and got it, and I have to say I ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT!!! :D
This phone is wonderful. Regarding the size I was a bit surprised how comfortable I was with it especially after having an s4 mini for the past 3 years. The phone is faster than my former of course and the battery lasts me the whole day where at the very least my mobile data/wifi is always on. It is also lighter than I expected for its size and material and even with a case its slimmer than my s4 mini. The camera quality is excellent and I truly appreciate all the little bells and whistles they added to the phone. I've seen a couple persons comment on the touch sensitivity being too sensitive, and I can understand their point because from the get go I applied a 5 layer tempered glass privacy screen protector and with all of that on there you would think I would have problems with sensitivity, but I don't, so I do agree that an update should come to allow users to adjust the sensitivity on the phone. I had go launcher on my other phone but I don't find the need for it here, only thing I miss is the carousel home screen with the continuous scroll but I can survive without that.
All and all its great a phone so far; I haven't put it down for a second since I got it, I'm always using it for one thing or the other. Furthermore, I hardly use my Galaxy Tab S 8.4 now that I have it, and my tablet and I were inseparable.

So with all of that said I upgraded my rating from a 3 to a 4 star, and let me tell you, if there was a dedicated slot for my SD card so that I can use that along with my second sim, I would have surely given this 5+++ stars. But the truth is, not having expandable memory won't be a problem, at least not for the next year or so given that I presently have 18 GBs left after I transferred what I wanted from my old device. Btw, when you first get the phone just over 24 GBs are available for storage, system memory takes up just over 7 GBs of the total 32.

So YES I am still somewhat disappointed in Samsung for not giving me 3 slots, but apart from that, this S7 was surely a pleasant upgrade :).

*************************************************************************************************************************************************************
I have a serious concern regarding the dual sim variant of this phone (G930fd). I just downloaded the user manual to realise that I could might as well say that I either have a single sim S7 with expandable memory, or a dual sim S7 without expandable memory, because for the dual sim version there are only 2 slots and you have to place sim 2 card and the microsd card in the same slot, while the manual clearly states:
•  You cannot insert a nano-SIM card and a microSD card in tray 2 at the same time

I was so excited when I heard that Samsung was bringing back expandable memory to their phones but that obviously makes no difference and is of no value to dual sim users, because we have to choose what is more important to us, having expandable memory, or a second line.

I haven't bought the phone as yet, and now I'm not sure what to do, because I am coming from an S4 mini duos which has a designated slot for a microsd card in addition to the 2 slots for 2 sim cards, and I'm in serious need of an upgrade, sigh.

I just wanted to make sure that dual sim lovers who are interested in this phone are aware of this con to the phone, at least its a con in my view. Plus I have been asking  if there are three slots and no one has responded to me as yet. So if someone who has actually purchased the phone can inform me whether I can have both sims and a microsd card, or not I would really appreciate it.

My last phone was the LG G4 international model, and it died after 9 months.

"","","It's a week now since I purchased this phone and have used it so very extensively for the  last 7 days. I have been a ios user for a long time and this switch to galaxy s7 has been very smooth and I have been enjoying it a lot. I was looking to buy a android phone for more than 2 months and I was looking for a phone that I can easily hold in my hand and use one hand to navigate through. Also I wanted a phone that had at least 10 MP rear camera with expandable storage. This phone ticks everything I needed. I can use the phone in one hand with ease and also the camera both rear and front are top notch. The battery life is also very good for as I can easily get back home with 30% to 35% of battery power still available to exhaust. I personally feel galaxy s7 combined with android has surpassed ios and latest apple phone in offering. There are many features in the where iphones cannot match. Sorry for adding this comparison as I cannot avoid it because everything else at my end run on ios.

Setting up the phone was a breeze and did not have any issues except for setting up my finger print capture for the first time.  Probably that's not the phone issue but it's an issue with me as I could not clearly capture the finger prints. However after one or two days as I got used to phone i was able to capture the finger prints easily. Further I wanted to buy an unlock version of this phone and purchased this from amazon directly. Since this is an international version you will not be able to register the device with Samsung US account. Also you will be missing samsung pay and it did not bother me much as I don't think I will ever use it. Other than these aspects this phone has been quite awesome and an wonderful experience.","5.0 out of 5 stars"

But I am giving only 2 stars.  No matter what, this phone always uses data unless your data is already turned off before you turn on your phone. (not waking from sleep mode, you literally reboot the phone) So, if your phone is turned on and is on 4G meaning using Data and you find Wi Fi at the Airport or a Coffee shop or at Home you connect to that Wi-Fi then it still uses data. So, after connecting to Wi Fi I turned off data, I still see the 4G symbol and it still uses Data. I tested this several times and this is the result. Then the only way to use Wi Fi is to turn the phone off complete and turn it back on (reboot).","2.0 out of 5 stars"

I suggest if you going to buy the phone make sure to go to settings and go to the application manager and go to the battery and click on details there will be a option to save battery on every application you use if you don't you're going suffer alot of drainage in battery because sometimes apps stay in the background taking up all the ram and draining the battery life. One last thing for the us models it has a Sony camera sensor and a Qualcomm snapdragon processor and for other countries outside of the us it uses a Samsung exynos processor and a Samsung oiscell camera sensor. You also might want to buy a really good case because the phone is made of a glass back and aluminum alloy side and bottoms.","5.0 out of 5 stars"
