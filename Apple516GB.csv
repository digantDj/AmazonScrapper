Claim: iPhone 5s is a great product
The iPhone 5s is an amazing, easy-to-use product that you should buy for great benefits. The iPhone can hold a lot of gigabytes (GB) that can be helpful with storage space for pictures, apps, songs, and games. It can come in many different colors so you can pick from whatever colors you want, and it has its own personal servant called Siri. She looks up anything you ask her to. This iphone has so many great helpful pros to it!

The iphone 5s has a great amount of storage options. The most you can get is 64GB according to science.opposingviews.com. To all iphone buyers you could also have 16 and 32GB at a cheaper cost. But it is so worth paying more for the 64GB. That is a great amount of storage to have because it is always beneficial to have lots of pictures! Most people love to snap pictures and make more than enough memories, you can never take too many pictures to capture the moment! You never really have to worry about running out of storage and needing to delete things because you’ll already have a ton of storage. If you like to play games and have lots of apps it’s always beneficial to have 64GB. You can get games, get collage apps, editing apps, and all kinds of cool ones. If you have a lot of songs you’ll still be wonderful with storage!

Having lots of GB is great but color has a huge impact on what phone buyers decide to buy. Men typically want a darker phone where the girls want a lighter one, and the iPhone 5s lets you pick and choose your colors. You can mix it up! [...] says you can get a white or space gray iPhone with a gold, bronze, black, or silver middle. Most people feel that the color option makes the iPhone 5s look even better than the older versions like the iPhone 4 and 4s. Most people would rather be able to to change the color than have the same boring black phone that everyone else has. It gives you a chance to be unique! You can always take it in somewhere and get a different back or front if you change your mind and also, you can get a difft home button color. It’s always nice to have a great selection of colors to pick from!

Not only do we have a nice selection of colors, the iPhone has siri unlike other phones. Siri is helpful to anyone with an iphone that doesn’t feel like putting in their password just to look one thing up. It is really easy to use Siri on their phone too. All you have to do is hold down the middle button and say something clearly through the phone and Siri will answer you. Here is an example: I am stuck in middle of New York City, and I need to find Manhattan quickly so I’m not late for my meeting. I have no time to type in my password because I will be late. Then I remembered Siri is a quick way to look up something. Then I decided to hold down the home button and say “find the quickest way to get to Manhattan.” Siri then responds, “The quickest way to get to Manhattan is by walking because of traffic, it will only take 5 minutes to walk there.” There is an example of how Siri is helpful. If you had any other phone when you were in that situation, you probably would be late to your meeting. Siri is beneficial to anyone with an Iphone.

Everyone needs to go out and get the iPhone 5s because it is the best phone that is out right now and is easy to use. [...] says that the apple phones are living large. The amount of GB, the color, and siri are only some of the great characteristics of the iPhone 5s!","4.0 out of 5 stars"

We don't use unlocked phones as we use Verizon but I thought that some people would like to see what the phones looked like and hear about the phone installation process from someone who has gone through it.  One phone was easy to set up and install and the other phone had issues.  Even though the phones came from Verizon the gold 64 GIG phone SIM would not register with Verizon's servers.  It took Verizon about 45 minutes to get the phone's SIM to be forced into the system while I was on the phone with them. This has been a problem with this new phone and the carriers are slowly resolving the issues.

The fingerprint recognition system is really neat and easy to set up.  You can register 5 fingers and so I registered two of mine depending on the different ways that I would grip the phone and then my wife registered on my phone.  We then did the same thing on her phone.  I immediately changed the simple password to a complex one and I strongly suggest that you do the same thing.  The four digit number code is just too easy to break.  You can program your phone to erase itself after 10 failed log in attempts but we have not done that as of yet. I figure that the fingerprint access and a complex password will slow them down a lot!

In my video I did not go through the technical details as Apple has them plastered all over the web in a much better format that I could do justice to.  For us we were looking to going to the LTE system (Faster Speed), making our phones be personal hotspots for our WIFI iPads, the finger print security and the enhanced camera and slow motion videos were of interest for us.

I did notice that the iPhone 5S runs warmer and it feels warmer in my hand.  I had my iPhone 4 in an Otterbox Defender case all the time that I owned it and perhaps it was just as warm and I never noticed it because of the case.  We were able to trade in our old phones and we got a reasonable trade in value for them and that helped with the expense of a new phone.

After the phones are registered you can only make basic calls and texting but all of your personal information is not on the phone.  I don't use iCloud as I don't want to pay for 64 GIG of backup space but I use iTunes religiously.  I backed up both of our phones before I turned off the old iPhone 4 products.  I then connected the new iPhone 5S phones and one took 1 hour and 35 minutes and the other about 1 hour and 45 minutes to sync.  I was immediately asked to upgrade to a new version of IOS 7 which took an additional 30 minutes or so for each phone.  Now all of our data was there except our MP3 music and MP4 videos that had to be reinstalled.  If you use apps that require unique passwords you will have to reregister and reenter your passwords.

The phones knew who we had our email accounts with but again we had to re-enter in our email account passwords and then they immediately downloaded.  Syncing , downloading emails and adding music and videos to your new phone is much faster thanks to the new quad core CPU.

The phones are beautiful and stylish and we both like our phones a lot.  We both would rate them as a 5 star item.  We like iPhones and we have a ton of iTunes apps which so far has kept us rebuying iPhones. It has been a good product line for us and so far we are happy.","5.0 out of 5 stars"

As I compare the two, note that both the iPhone 4 and 5S were running on the same carrier with the same plan.

Pros:
- Lots of memory
- Quick processor (when it didn't lock up)
- Great camera
- Lightweight
- The fingerprint sensor is a godsend if you need to have a ""strong"" password, and it works very well

Cons:
- Poor phone reception -- no phone service on the first floor of my house (my iPhone 4 gets two bars/dots and doesn't drop calls when I step in the house)
- Bad 2G (Edge network) reception -- despite having a connection it can't get mail, connect to servers, etc (again, my iPhone 4 would connect in the same places without problems, albeit slowly)
- Phone pauses/locks up in some apps (email and iMessage were notable since they're apps that come with the phone) and the home button needs to be pushed repeatedly to escape
- The battery life is no better than my now 2+ yr old iPhone 4

In the end the iPhone 5S went back because it wasn't worth taking a step backwards in cell and data coverage combined with a steep price tag.  I was very disappointed.","1.0 out of 5 stars"

Its funny that none of the support folks know that information. I had to find this the hard way out after spending several hours calling each of the stores and then the support.

Its been 4 months apple launched the phone 5s and you guys tell me to shell 269$ to get a new phone. You guys will loose customers in this way. You have definitely lost me. I am not buying any apple product again. To me you guys are a rip off.","1.0 out of 5 stars"

Yes it is another iPhone but with this updated version comes many new features.  The purpose of the iPhone is to serve people that require a higher standard of technology out of their mobile device. I believe that the aim of apple in creating the iPhone 5s was to create a better version of the previous version to keep and edge on their competition and ultimately make more money.
My evaluation of the product is that it is a great device. The new improvements begin with a sleeker design than before and slightly different hardware scheme. The biggest improvement is the new touch id sensor. This allows someone to use his or her fingerprint to gain access into the phone. The next biggest improvement is the camera. Its improvements in picture sharpness and low light visibility far outdo the previous model.
 Some of the negatives of the product include the screen, which has remained exactly the same. As most people know who have owned an iPhone in the past will know that one of the biggest problems is the battery life. The life of the battery has always been an issue with iPhones and this model is no exception with the problem still occurring. All i can say is that i hope they fix this on the next model that is released. Also the iPhone 5s continues to be the most expensive smartphone on the market. The final thing that has gotten the iPhone models criticism in previous years and continues to be a problem for the 5s is its battery life. The life of the battery per charge still seems to be a slight issue even with the iPhone 5s.
 In conclusion I believe that over all the iPhone 5s is a great product. I have had an older model iPhone for many years now and they just don't compare to the competition in my opinion. The technology is always one step above the competition and the platform is very user friendly. These reasons are why the IPhone sells so many units every time they release a new model. Im sure the iPhone 5 will be the same way. When a product is better than the completion it always sells better. This has been shown through the number sold being extraordinarily high regardless of it being the most expensive smart phone out there. I think that it is a great phone and is very up to date on the technology. If you have been thinking about one, its undoubtedly worth looking into.","3.0 out of 5 stars"

It offers everything any other phone has, and it has a lot more than many phones can offer. The iphone 5s is one of two new apple cell phones that came out in September of 2013. It is fun, helpful, easy to use, and I could not be happier to own it, and I have never owned a phone that does so many things with so little flaws. Although I said it has few flaws, it could make or break someones purchase of it. The iphone 5s is supposed to have a bigger battery, but It dies way to quickly for me. You cannot be on the internet long, listen to music long or even constantly text without it dieing quickly. It is extremely sensitive to touches, it can turn on the voice command with a touch of the home button, and it will call people without you knowing if you do not lock it back when your done. The phone cannot use the iphone 4, 4s, 5, or 5c cases due to the home button, so you have to buy certain cases for the phone. The final flaw I have with it, is that the phone is that the lock screen is slow sometimes. However, the good things it has to offer are way too many to say, but the main things are super cool. It offers a ton of apps like games, social media, emails, calculator, flashlights, fitness, health, banking, reminders, calendars, and so much more. This phone even comes in black, white, and gold, so you have options now. The back of the phone is not even made of glass anymore, so it is a better chance of not cracking it. This phone has a thumb print scanner that allows you to enter your phone, download apps, or update your phone. This phone is the only one I have heard of that has this. It just keeps your thumb print in the memory of the phone, and you place your thumb on the home button and it will allow you and you only into your phone.The camera comes with an LED flash, filters, slow motion videos, panorama pictures, and takes amazing pictures. The phone comes with siri which is the voice command that talks to you, gives you GPS, gives you close gas stations, gives you close restaurants, sends text messages on your command, and calls people on your command. That is really a site to see. Lastly, it opens up Microsoft documents and even PDF files for anyone that uses it for business, and it is good quality too.

bad: inside the lifeproof case audio quality gets cut in half, in phone calls most of the time people couldn't hear me unless i had the headphone jack port open. touch ID works 90 percent the time when using lifeproof case, if you use a aux cable and want to use a bulky case well you will need to use a extender.","5.0 out of 5 stars"

It has a few dents/scratches on the exterior of the phone but nothing too bothersome. I have used the phone for about two week now it works pretty good, I can text, surf, and call. However,  I am noticing that sometimes the Bluetooth and the WiFi stop working. The phone would be connected to 4G network, switch to WIFI, and it take a while for the phone to connect. Once it does connect to the WIFI, the signal interprets/breaks and connects repeatedly. The bluetooth has similar issues, sometimes it is difficult to pair a headset or to the PC.","2.0 out of 5 stars"

It is way cheaper just to get one from your carrier and unlock it yourself.  There are ways.  The iPhone 5s is awesome though!!

I have been using the Apple iPhone since it was first introduced and I am currently using the Apple iPhone 5s.  All though this write up is Apple iPhone 5s based, my experience with this phone goes back to the Apple iPhone 1 and the tips and tricks on this page will work on all iPhones including the older generations.  I love the Apple iPhone and will never use another cell phone, because I am able to do so much with this phone.  It's funny because making phone calls is one of the lesser activities that I do with it.  I have checked out android phones and even though there are tons of apps there, I don't feel that there are as many useful apps as you can find for the Apple iPhone.  My phone keeps track of all my internet log in's.  The new calender app is very very useful at keeping me on schedule.

The Google Maps app keeps me from getting lost.  I do have a vehicle with GPS navigation, but prefer my Apple iPhone over it.  The camera on the Apple iPhone is my main camera for this website and I love how clear the pictures turn out.  My only complaint about the built in app is that it does not have a self timer.  The Pan and Slo Mo options that Apple has added is awesome to play with.  I can control my home thermostat with my phone.  I can turn my home security system on and off with my phone.  The new finger print reader is insane too.  I love that I can just hover my finger over the unlock button and my finger print logs me in, instead of having to type in a code every time I want to use my phone.  I've had friends over the years arguing with me which phone is the best.

They would swear up and down that their Blackberry is better, or their Android blows the iPhone out of the water.  Guess what, after watching me with my iPhone for a few months they always end up with one in less than a year.  I am putting this page together since there are so many options and settings that many of my friends ask me how to do some basic stuff.  If you wonder why the iPhone doesn't do something, it most likely does and you just need to look around a little to find the setting or option to make it do what you want.

  The price. Who sells a frigging iPhone for that cheap? Were talkin IPHONES HERE!!! Either the iPhone is a piece of crap, or its used. Sadly, with this iPhone, its both. Normally the 5S brand new itself is between 450$ to 600$. NEWWW. not used, NEWWW. the price for this one is about 200$ off its least amount price.
  The picture. Now I bet y'all are wondering, ""How can you tell from the picture??"" ... Simple. Look at this iPhone. Just the screen. Its normal looking right? Except for one thing...  The screen is very light colored. Almost faded looking. Take a screen shot of this one. Seriously, do it right now. Now look at another 5s. One that's about... 400-600 bucks. One that people say is NEWWWWWWWWWW! ACTUALLY new! Now take a screenshot of that one... Maker sure the screen is visible... This 5S screen looks likes an iPhone 3 took the picture!!
  Back the look... Again about the screen. People who have a 5s, that's completely new, no new home screen or any apps, take that phone and look at you're phone, and this one. Youres looks better right? Now I bet you're thinking: ""Its taken by a camera, this 5s of course is gonna look bad"", you're right. But this is by the apple product themselves!!! And they take professionals with proffesional camera to take this! If the rest of the phone is good camera quality, the screen is gonna be good too.","1.0 out of 5 stars"

Side note: Like Coke and Pepsi, there will be folks that are biased toward one or the other, but my hope is to point out some key differences should it help others in their overall decision making process.

iPhone 5s
-Better native keyboard – more precise and predictive. More natural feel when typing. The auto correct is great on the 5s.
-Siri – Smoother and better voice accuracy. More natural and intuitive. I provide commands (“remind me about the 8am dentist appointment on December 31th”) and Siri understands. If I issued the same command on the Galaxy S4, the voice recognition would be confused and misinterpret.
-The overall Volume of speaker is louder on the 5s than on the Galaxy S4. I can hear the ringer from other rooms.
-In my car and using the speakerphone on the 5s, others tell me the sound quality is night and day compared to the Galaxy S4 (Verizon). When I had my S4 (two different ones), they said I sounded garbled or as if I was talking through a tin can.
-I have yet to experience an application crash on the 5s
-The Camera is quick to snap shots and pictures are sharp
-Availability of iMessage and Facetime. Makes communicating with other Apple users simple. I can see when they are typing a reply back to me, and I can even Facetime in the car or from anywhere without having to download an configure a 3rd party app such as Skype, and then hope the person on the other end had done the same (I have family who are not technology savvy, but easily use Facetime).
-The iOS7 operating system is overall more refined and user friendly (i.e. – you can hold down and click X to delete an application on the iPhone rather than get confused trying to find the Settings/Application submenus on the Android/S4)
-In my area, better overall signal quality / antenna strength. No dropped calls in the same spots I used my S4.

Galaxy S4
-I like having a ‘Back’ button (bottom left arrow)
-The S4 has a larger screen / more real estate
-The S4 camera can lag (would display ‘Processing’ message for 2-3 seconds while images save). Images were often blurry or not as sharp as I had hoped even after adjusting various settings.
-I do like having a removable battery and accessories available with the S4 such as a wireless charger.
-I don’t like having to close various apps at least daily when they lock up/crash (Android Force Close / Process Stopped Unexpectedly errors). This may be more developer related than phone related, however, this does not happen with my iPhone 5s.
-Larger variety of apps. Not as restrictive as Apple in how you can modify and customize your phone (could be both a pro and con). I also like being able to use the Amazon App Store, where you can get a free download each day.

Overall impressions:
For me personally, the iPhone 5s is the way to go. Although the perfect phone, for me, would include combining the best features from both, Apple is the clear winner with regards to the features and functionality that matter most to me.","4.0 out of 5 stars"

I find their consumer products and iOS to be simply better than any alternative. Having said that, upgrading to the 5s was magical. It's an absolutely stunning piece of hardware, and it is a perfect complement to iOS7. The day I bought this phone (release day) I toyed around with some of the Samsung and LG smartphones in the ATT store. I was actually somewhat impressed with these devices as well, but I would never pass up on this phone (5s) to get one of them, even at a better price. I enjoy paying a premium for quality, and that is what the 5s is. The quality is impeccable.

I love the fingerprint reader. I never locked my iPhone 4s before, but its ease of use makes it far more logical to leave my phone locked.

I have read some of the reviews of the 5c, and most are pretty rough. I played around with it at the apple store the other day, and while I wasn't blown away, I wasn't disappointed either. I will likely gift this phone to family for the holidays because they will appreciate the colors and how cool it looks with iOS7 (they aren't as tech savvy and younger). I think the price on the 5c is definitely higher than one would like especially without a contract, but the internal quality doesn't seem to be as bad as some of the reviews I was reading.

All in all, this phone, as with almost all of the iPhone updates, is ahead of the competition, and the premium price is worth it.","5.0 out of 5 stars"

It is a lot different than I had expected.

Cons:
I had expected Siri to be more accurate, even though it is helpful sometimes.
I wish you could have Live Wallpapers
When you set a photo to wallpaper, it zooms in too much on the photo
Screen size- I wish that it was a bit bigger, considering that the Droid MINI has a bigger screen than the iPhone 5S, Apple kinda made a few customers unhappy.
I wish that you could get most of the same apps as you can on Google Play

Pros:
The fingerprint scanner is amazing. But if you don't think that you're gonna use it, just get the 5C for $100 cheaper
The iPhone 5 and 5S can apply to the same case- Something that I really like about it
iOS
iSight Camera
Ability to connect by iCloud- I can watch TV shows, play movies, or listen to music without downloading it to my iPhone 5S
Slo-Mo Video option, square, and panorama
A7 Chip and Processor- It literally does make it nearly as fast as a computer
And a lot more- Too much to explain

Overall, this is a five star product and I would only recommend this if you care about how fast it is, the fingerprint scanner, slo-mo video, or screen size.
Or, the 5C- Not as fast (but still fairly quick), and the 4-inch display.
If you don't care about any of this, but you still want iOS 7 and siri, or just an iPhone in general (you get the point), you can get the iPhone 4S, with Siri, but not as big of a screen size, for usually less than a dollar with a two year contract.

The $99 deals abound not just for mother's day and store employees have been given this device in exchange for the last lowest commonn demoninator model - the ipod touch.

***

This phone is not as audible as the 4 for an unknown reason - it has to be on its maximum volume level and even then words are missed and you have to ask the caller to repeat themselves.

The White/Silver version looks VERY Korean.  It's not slick and sophisticated in my opinion.  It evokes the spirit of a Samsung smartphone in white that has been shrunk down.  If this were the Iphone6, I would be much happier since a Samsung Galaxy Note 3 order was cancelled to get this phone but we felt we really needed an updated smartphone.  Hopefully, Apple devices will retain their resalability.

We have laptops and rokus using wifi with no problem but the touch 4g always buffered after a few minutes and you would think that this latest and greatest would have as decent wifi as a $35 Roku LT but that is not the case.  Since I am not an Apple addict, I would return this phone and never touch another Apple device but I am not primary user of this brand's products so I try to do as much research as I can stomach to cushion the expected frustrations of signing on to own and participate in this artificial reality.

The sensor issues seem to be due to a new supplier, Bosch, and that means ALL the new phones are affected and Apple is not known for doing a product recall.  The sensors are off by DIFFERENT degrees so it is not believable that any firmware or app will be able to offset the sensor - at best, they will embed software that will throw the sensors off in the opposite direction to minimize the amount it is off level.  SO LAME. I haven't pulled out a carpenter's level yet to test it but the ongoing revelations including a teardown of the phone indicate that Bosch screwed up and all 5s and 5c owners will be stuck with this because Apple never fixed antennagate on the iPhone 4.  They certainly never contacted owners of the 4 to offer them a free case as their idea of a ""fix"" for the antenna problem.

It takes forever for the fingerprint sensor to identify your fingerprint so get comfortable before you press your finger on it because you can't lift it up until Apple is finished.

SIRI is a toy - an elaborate Magic 8 Ball with more responses tuned in.  It is easier to voicedial on a dumbphone than to use Siri's primary purpose in life because ultimately, Siri is NOT AT ALL intelligent.  What Siri does do if you play around long enough to realize is RECORD YOUR VOICE and then repeat what you said in Siri's voice which means their software coded your voice and translated into Siri's voice - it does NOT mean that Susan Bennett happened to record the same words that you just spoke to Siri.  That in addition to the fingerprint sensor and the cameras mean this device can COPY you.

Still, we are okay with upgrading to this phone.  There simply were too many things after two years that the Iphone 4 could not do like iBook.  We never updated the iOS 4 sparing us battery issues like the ones for the Touch 4G so this is how we think the Apple devices work - when you can afford to upgrade, pick the latest model even if an older version is free so you don't get locked out of new features like ""autofocus"" that only works with the 5s camera.

Don't sell your old iphone for ninety bucks or whatever.  Keep it and don't order product protection so if the new phone gets destroyed or stolen before the two years are up, you have a cheaper backup than the monthly protection plan.

When the next iphone after your version is iminent, upgrade your iOS and then never upgrade it again to spare yourself all the coincidental problems that make you want to upgrade to the latest and greatest that don't suffer all these handicaps after ugprading to the new iOS.

Scour the repetitive articles and then turn off all the settings that drain the battery like auto app refresh.

KNOW that Apple does not do product recalls and be careful with overcharging your nonremovable battery.  If not for Android updating and malware issues, we would have broken from Buying American (Chinese suicides) for the Samsung Galaxy Note 3.  Ultimately, we just didn't want to do too much work with a smartphone so we are still with Apple.  Apple customer service is not that great, not at all generous but if we have to have a smartphone which is driven by the media to be a keeping up with the Jones, it is better to be with the operating system that seems favored by app developers and yes, there is a cultural comfort level with dealing with an American brand.

After our problems with the touch 64gb and Apple customer service being no help with the battery issue, we are loathe to max out storage for any Apple device with nonremovable memory and battery but 16gb fills up pretty easily so we are going with 32 gb.  The Iphone has not sold me on Mac computers which I have never owned and I think are overpriced and some kind of IDEA of computing that is not value for money though it may look and be easy to use.  As smartphones go however, Android is an unpreposessing name and so are their iterations especially ""jellybean"" - very offputting.  The fact that even if you don't mind not getting a timely OS update may still kill the apps you do have and that malware is an issue with the apps forcing some phones to get bricked is why we are not indulging in the tempting Samsung offerings.

We don't trust Apple because of what we learned from the touch 4g battery issues but we don't trust nonApple brands more as a result of not trusting Apple.

The issues with Gmail privacy have certainly cast suspicion on the integrity of what Google does including their Android OS.  Whatever happened to not being evil?

If Microsoft had the breadth of apps and media products for sale (Android doesn't have the scope of the iTunes store) then I would consider a Windows phone but browsing the Android app store - no South Park episodes! - made me cancel the order for the Samsung Galaxy Note 3.  Hopefully, the resale market for Apple will still be healthy then - another difference from Android phones.

CASE of choice:

Tylt Energi Power Case for iPhone 5/5S - Retail Packaging - Black/Gray which is subtly shaped in a charming way and feels MUCH better than the rubbery grippy silicone cases so even if it did not provide the extended battery, I would still use this case BUT the lightning cables are no longer needed as it has a provided micro usb cable.

CASES THAT BLOW:

SPIGEN SGP SGP10088 Slim Armor Case for iPhone 5/5S - 1 Pack - Retail Packaging - Metal Slate has a too low ridge around the front offering little if any protection and it was too thick to allow the lightning cable from monster to charge the phone.  I am using the provided screen protector however.

The very expensive Lifeproof iPhone 5 Case - 1 Pack - Retail Packaging - White And Gray covers the fingerprint sensor but shows the back of the phone so everyone know which color you got and they are coming out with a case for the 5s BUT I got the feeling it was scratching the sides of the phone when I tested it out.

If Buying American, Choosing Apple versus Google's Motorola, REMEMBER The Pacific and know that if Apple falls, so might these suppliers:

Japanese electronics makers appear incapable of making the world-winning products that they made a generation ago. Even credit agencies are not optimistic about their prospects. Sony's credit rating? Junk. Sharp? Junk. Panasonic? Junk.

Research by Morikawa and Goto shows how in 2012 Japan's electronics giants were using Apple as a life support system.

Some of the figures are staggering.

At Sharp's Kameyama No. 1 factory near Osaka, 100 percent of liquid-crystal display panels were devoted to Apple. Of the camera sensors from Sony's Kumamoto factory, 50 percent were for the US company's devices. Half of the DRAM production at Elpida's Hiroshima factory: for Apple.","3.0 out of 5 stars"

I think this is a joke. Absolutely no new feature after Siri. Yes a faster processor, but I guess that was needed as the new OS is soo slow on older iphones anyway. I guess this was intentional so that customers are forced to upgrade from a slower experience that they get in their iphone 4,4S and 5.

I would rather buy an unlocked S4 and Kindle HDX (or a nokia lumia 1020 and surface 2) for the same price depending on whether I want an android or a windows experience.","1.0 out of 5 stars"

On a day to day basis the iPhone 5S does everything I want it to do, and does the things I do most, better than any other phone I’ve used. It’s not gimmicky and other than the lack of widgets and customisations there’s not much I miss from using bigger Android phones. If, as expected, Apple does up the screen size in the iPhone 6 I’ll be interested to see whether I’ll enjoy the experience quite as much.","4.0 out of 5 stars"

I bought it from Apple with a 2 year AT&T Contract.  The phone is amazing.  It is so fast compared to the 4.  All of my APS boot up with lightning speed.  The screen is clear, crisp and the colors great.  The battery life is about the same as my four.  I live in an area with very poor cell phone reception.  It is my feeling that the 5s handles that better than did the four.  Areas that I could not make calls from on my 4 are doable with the 5s.

Only short messages without name, adress or phonenumber! This ist not serious!
The Iphone 5S can be unlocked by T-Mobile USA on the basis of IMEI No. He just needs cause.
Why the dealer does not do that? Something seems to be wrong here. I come only in June back to the U.S..
I will appoint a lawyer to examine the issue.

IPhone 5S is the last year’s flagship from Apple .The design is pretty much the same like the previous iPhone the iPhone 5 which looks very premium and well-built but the hardware has been changed featuring 4-inch Retina display; Touch ID sensor; 8MP Camera and A7 Dual-core processor. The iPhone 5S price starts from 200$. Available in space gray, silver and gold.

Personal Review:

· The Screen is 16:9 offering a resolution of 1,1360x640 with 326pixels per inch. It is relatively bright.  It can be easily seen at sunny days comparing it to other phones in the market.

· The Touch ID sensor is integrated into the metal ring around the home button. I find it to work well and responds fast especially after the new update and you can setup up to 5 fingerprints. It takes few seconds to do so but make sure that your finger is dry.

· The iPhone 5S camera on paper is very similar to the one on the iPhone 5 however, it has been magnificently improved especially the low-light performance because apple has enlarged the sensor from 1/ 3.2 to 1/ 3. The camera overall takes glorious pictures and stable videos as it is very responsive and fast in processing pictures but I have a problem with the focusing as it doesn’t detect small objects to focus on so what I do is I focus it on my hand from the same distance of the object and lock the settings.It is very easy to capture professional photos I mean god knows I am amateur in photography and stuff like that but I took pictures that look very professional in my opinion. In darker conditions, the objects are barely visible apart from the fact that there are some obvious noise but it is way better than other flagships.

· The iPhone 5S is the first phone to feature a 64bit processor allowing the developers to make better quality applications and to run apps faster and smoother.

·  It also have a secondary processor called “M7” which is used mainly for low-power tracking of movements. Some apps have taken advantage of it like the M7 pedometer and what it basically does is counting the number of steps you take every day.

· The battery life is above the average which I charge it sometimes more than once a day when using it intensively however it charges very fast.

.The IOS 7 has a great user interface and smooth transitions but I think it’s more optimized for the iPhone 5C and I hate it when I download an app that has the old keyboard.

 Overall it’s a great phone despite the fact that the screen size is relatively small to its rivals.

I will work my way back to the AT&T store tomorrow through all of the holiday traffic, but I'm sure they won't have a replacement in stock 3 days before Christmas. I probably lost all of the pictures I took today since it backs up to the cloud nightly.

Finally I took the phone under a bright light and managed to read and give the correct serial number to the agent. It seems that people who designed the new 5s screens do not have good common sense and Apple has not had proper review of the visual design before making the phone available to the public. My old iPhone 4 screen design was much much better. Also I do not understand why Apple insists to keep the phone screen size so small?

I just upgraded from a Blackberry Storm 2. My wife has an iPhone 5 and previously had a Motorola Droid 2. These are the phones that I can compare to, so keep that in mind when reading my review.

My first impression out of box was that the phone was beautiful. I seriously didn't even want to touch it. I debated between space gray and white silver. I ultimately chose white silver because my wife has a black iPhone 5 and everything electronic I have is black. I though white was refreshing and if I can always put a case on to make it any color I want. I am so happy I chose white. It really makes the phone look fresh - sorry that is the best word I can find to describe it. The colors on the screen pop against the background. It doesn't show finger prints as much as my wives black phone.

I got a clear case for the phone that just adds to the appearance. It also protects it from scratches and drops. In my opinion a case is required for an iPhone 5S. I honestly think that Apple designed it with the intent to use it with a case. Other competitive phones advertise a built in grip or that it feels better to hold than an iPhone, which is probably true. Apple made the phone so thin and light that adding a case just makes it feel better. Where other phones if you add a case it just makes the phone larger and heavier. I personally like putting my phone in a case. It is a way to personalize your phone and protect it. If the case gets dirty or worn, just spent $10 or $20 bucks and buy a new one.

The screen on the iPhone is not as large as some of the Android giants. Android seems believe that a bigger screen is better. For me this doesn't make sense. I carry my phone in my pocket which you can do with the iPhone 5S because it is skinny enough to fit. I also like that I can reach all the screen with one hand. The screen is much larger than my old Blackberry. The retina display is beautiful. The colors and crispness are very pleasing to look at. It seem similar to my wives iPhone 5. Does clarity make a difference - yes it prevents eye strain. I have had no trouble with the moving elements on the display. I have no idea why people are complaining about that, but maybe they have some vision troubles or motion sickness issues. You can turn off the moving screen and I would expect future IOS 7 updates to allow users to disable all features people are complaining about.

I use the phone for work and the speakerphone is in use for several hours a day. The sound quality is great on speaker phone, on handset and with headset. My wife noted an improvement over my Blackberry.

The camera is incredible - even better than my wives iPhone 5. I am getting rid of our Nikon compact camera because the quality is so good. The video modes are so easy to switch between. It takes no time to shoot a phone and upload or send it multiple ways. I am still discovering all the features but some items like panorama and slow motion are just fun to use.

E-mail is way better on the iPhone than my Blackberry. Calendar integration for Outlook is awesome.

The speed of the phone is really fast. There are never any delays on anything and touch response is immediate and accurate. I have not had apps crash, but I don't doubt there are some buggy ones out there. Just nothing I am using.

The touch ID has been getting a ton of attention - good and bad. When I got the phone it scanned my thumb and took just a minute to complete. I scanned it at all angles. It works perfectly. In the last month I have only had a couple times that I needed to reposition my thumb to get it read properly. It was due to me not having it on all the way. It will read your print from many different angles. This feature for me is HUGE. My company mandates a password that has lower, upper, number, special character 8 digit password. That is a total pain to enter in the phone throughout the day. My companies security team has approved touch ID as an alternate. That means no more password. Just to be clear the phone still has a password, so you can optionally use it. For example if your touch id gave you trouble or wanted to get access to your spouse or friend. Plus you can load multiple fingers. I don't know why other people are reporting troubles with touch ID. I assume either their phone is defective or their finger print is damaged by cracked skin. I have some experience with finger print scanners from a previous job and we did have one employee with dry hands that could not be read on a finger print scanner. The issue is that his skin was cracked and cracks kept healing and showing up in new places. In other words the scanner had nothing consistent to read. I am sorry for those people that suffer a skin condition but to blame the phone for not reading it is not really fair. Those people will have to use the password which is no worse than any other phone.

Battery time seems ok. I need to charge it every day but I use it all the time. I am used to charging my phone every night. I purchased an external battery pack for recharge when I travel if I cannot find an outlet at an airport.

I purchased the 32 GB the day after it was released and waited 2 weeks for delivery. Verizon sent it overnight delivery.

Final thoughts - this phone is the best and fastest according to speed tests. It has changed my life my making things easier. That may sound over the top, but it is my first iPhone. After comparing it to the iPhone 5 I would say it is better. I don't have an iPhone 5C but as I understand the hardware is similar to my wives iPhone 5. Honestly I am sure you would be happy with an iPhone 5C if you are trying to decide. You would be missing the touch id and better camera. You gain colors and a more comfortable feel (without case). I chose the 5S because I use my phone all day for work. I need the best tools for my job.

-----------------
Added May 7, 2014

I have had the phone for 6 months now. I thought I should include an update:

First I want to talk more about the finger print scanner (touch ID). For me this is a huge feature because my company requires complex password entry. The touch ID allows me to instantly get into my phone by touching it with my thumb at any angle. The touch ID has always worked fairly well for me. When I first got the phone I would occasionally need to reposition my thumb. I also found issues after having my hands in water a long time because when your skin is wet it puckers up and therefore the fingerprint is distorted. That is totally acceptable in my opinion. I also found that if my thumb was only half on the button it may not work the first time, but I always got in on a second try,. With the recent IOS updates I get in on the first touch every time. It is really amazing how well it works. It works so well that I have tested it with non-registered fingers a couple times just to make sure it was still working. Compared to the new Samsung scanner that you have to swipe your finger, the touch ID is way better. It may seem minor but think about how many times you get into your phone every day.

I carry the phone in my front pocket and it fits well in my jeans pocket. I have not broken the screen or had any issues with scratches. I use no screen protector because I like a clearer view on the screen.

I still use a case on my phone and find when the phone is out of the case it is not comfortable to hold. I would recommend to Apple that future designs have rounded corners similar to my iPad so it can be used without a case. This would not stop me from buying the phone, because I would never use my phone without a protective case, but I know some people who do. I have dropped my phone several times with no issues, but I could just be lucky.

The Apple ecosystem is amazing. Every good app is available for iPhone first or exclusively in some cases. The shear number of iPhones and the high end nature of the device ensures developer attention.

The speed benchmarks indicate the 5S is the fastest smartphone. It also scores high on the most available memory. In other words if you buy a 16GB phone, keep in mind a good chunk of that is the operating system. Android can be bloated and take up considerable space. The Google versions are better. The 5S still scores as top selling phone with all carriers after 6 months, so the phone has staying power.

The battery needs charging daily. I use it for business and spend considerable time on the phone, so I feel I represent an extreme user. Sometimes I wish the battery was bigger, which Apple could easily do by increasing the phone size to match competitors. That is how Samsung and Motorola get the long battery time, by just making the phone thicker and heavier. Apple made the choice to keep the size and weight down. There are extended battery packs you can purchase. I have one that I use when I am traveling and it more than doubles the battery life.

Other phones have replaceable batteries. The battery on my old Blackberry went out after 1.5 years so the replaceable battery was great. Now by comparison I have a 4 year old iPod touch that still has a good battery and I know people who have iPhones several years old with good batteries. The point is that you only need a replaceable battery if the battery needs to be replaced. I know that sounds strange but if the battery is good it should last as long as the technology. For those that die early, they can be replaced at an Apple store. One other thing to consider - have you ever dropped your phone and the cover falls off. It happened to me all the time on my Blackberry, but with the iPhone when I drop it nothing falls apart.

Other phones have expanded memory capability. I have the 32GB version and the only time I have had trouble is when I loaded a bunch of videos on for watching while I work out. I had hours of video that I had already watched on the phone, so it was just a matter of me needing to delete what I had watched. As long as you are removing content you dont need from the phone, I found 32GB is more than enough.

The camera continues to work great. I have stopped using my camera and video cameral and I am getting rid of them. Everything I shoot is with my iPhone and the video is superior to my 4 year old Nikon camera and Panasonic video camera. I mean superior when shown on my 50 inch TV. When you consider that a good phone can replace devices that cost me six hundred dollars four years ago, that is amazing.

I am really still waiting for the true power of the 5S to be realized. The motion co processor and 64 bit CPU are so new that I am not sure they have even scratched the surface on what they can do. That is great because it means I will be able to enjoy future IOS updates and new features for a long time to come.

As I write this, I am waiting for a MacBook Air to arrive from Amazon. The iPhone has caused a chain reaction making me convert to Apple. I used to be the guy that said ""a windows laptop gives you more power for your money, Apple is just paying for a name"". I was wrong and I am here to tell you it is ok to convert to Apple.","5.0 out of 5 stars"

Here's the short list: Voice mail deletion is no good, stock browser is garbage, screen rotation is slow, camera is probably worst camera on the market, flash takes forever to focus the lens, battery percentage notification won't let you turn phone off when you're trying to with low battery, battery only last about 12 months with heavy usage and then this $700 is garbage, mic and noise cancellation mic do not work properly together, no one can ever hear me on this thing, mute switch is almost impossible to reach, finger print scanner cool idea but doesn't work properly, the way the apps all fall onto the screen each time you turn the phone on is annoying and there's no way to turn it off, may features have no preferences that absolutely need them, WIFI reception is poor, when your camera is full you can't even access the images which is extremely frustrating , you have to delete an app just to get back into camera roll, you can't delete multiple voice mails at once and it takes about 15 seconds of freezing up till a msg is actually deleted...

Apparently a lot of people like this feature.  But a lot of people also like ""2 and a Half Men"" and CSI.  My point is, a lot of people are idiots.

Seriously, this phone makes me irrationally angry each and every time I try to use headphones with it.  If I am working out, I have to set the phone upside down on the machine as I run.  If the phone is in my pocket, I am constantly flipping it over every time I take it out of my pocket.  That is annoying in and of itself, but it also causes the headphone cord to get tangled and shorten when I put it back into my pocket.  Also, it makes it difficult to work on the phone while listening to my headphones.  The cord sticking out from the bottom prevents me from using my pinky to stabilize the phone in my hand.  I almost never dropped my iPhone 4s in over two years that I had it.  I drop the iPhone 5s once a week because it won't let me hold it securely.

I realize I should not care this much about a headphone jack.  Maybe some people get used to it.  But that is like getting used to the smell of a dead animal in your house.  The feature sucks and it makes the entire phone suck.  I would not buy an iPhone 5s if I had it to do over again.","1.0 out of 5 stars"

It seems like apple has a bunch of engineers that just have to be clever, and really don't care about those of us who need a user friendly phone that we can put to use right away. I have had cell phones since they were portable units that plugged into the cigarette lighter and rode in the car seat.  But never in all the years, or all the phones, have I ever had one that is so unfriendly to operate. It trys to be way too helpful, and screws up a lot of what you are trying to do!  It would seem that the iTunes concept was designed for the young non-professional whose main interest in having a portable phone is to provide entertainment. Because once you plug the phone into your PC and try to download some of your material, it wants to sell you an app, or a tune, or a game, or a movie. (Who wants to watch a movie on such a small screen?) and trying to convince it that you simply want to download (They say sync.) some document or photo onto the iPhone is like trying to figure out a Rubik's cube that keeps changing the rules as you go. Then you have to keep entering your  I.D. and password to prevent some kind of cybernetic road block from taking place.  This is all fine if you don't have anything else to do, and you might even enjoy the small size that makes it fit well in a shirt pocket or hide in a purse.  But for those of us that have other things to do in our lives, it is a real frustration.  We have several kinds of cell phones in our company, and we got this one to try it out.  Needless to say, we have no plans to provide our employees with something like this that will make them waste a lot of time.  My Grandson says they are great once you get used to them.  But I would rather wait until they make something more practical before I buy any more toys.","3.0 out of 5 stars"

I got the Q10 (the one with the physical keyboard, of course), and within days, make that hours, I was appalled what a terribly poorly designed phone it was. Long story short: out of sheer desperation, I returned the Q10 after 2 weeks and took back my old (but beloved) BlackBerry Bold, which then was already more ""old"" than ""bold"". Well, it finally happened and last week my Bold simply gave out after years of trusted service. I had no other choice (here at work) but to get an iPhone. I absolutely dreaded it. It's been just over a week now...

Let me just say it: I have been incredibly pleased with this phone. The design is clear and simple, and the essential functions for me (email, texting, internet access) are readily accessible. If I compare this to the BlackBerry Q10, the ease of use is like day and night. The biggest transitional challenge going from BlackBerry to the iPhone has been the typing without using a physical keyboard. Everyone tells me that it will get better as I get more used to it, so that makes me hopeful/optimistic.

I must admit that I haven't tried out the dozens and dozens of features, apps and whatever other goodies are on the 5s phone. I assume I'll get to it eventually. or maybe not. It's not that important to me. Bottom line is that my sense of dread to convert from BlackBerry to the iPhone was unwarranted. Had I known this last year when I gave up on the BlackBerry Q10, I surely would've gone to the iPhone then. Oh well. (As to the BlackBerry product design team: they should all be canned, every single one, if they haven't been yet.) To all other remaining CrackBerry addicts: do not fear the future any longer! Come on over to the iPhone 5s, you will be surprised how easy the transition it. The iPhone 5s is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!","4.0 out of 5 stars"

A techie like you doesn't have an iPhone???"") I finally broke down and bought one- the top of the line, with all the bells and whistles, and the maximum memory. It's a bit of a hit to the pocketbook, but I thought the payoff would be in portability and the computing power. And for the most part, I've been pleased with it. I love how it shares data with my iMac and iPad. But I do have some issues.

It's certainly amazing how Apple has managed to cram all that computing power and battery life into such a tiny package, but they've done so at the expense of ruggedness and battery life. The first purchase I made for mine was an Otterbox Defender, and the second, an auxiliary battery and a second charging cord for in-car use. The case, because I can just see dropping this wand watching $849 turn into several ounces of inert plastic, glass and silicon, and the cord and battery because compared to the cell phones I've been using, this phone is a real power hog. While it gets a lot of oohs and aaahs for its tiny packaging, it would be nice if they made it a bit thicker and doubled the battery capacity. It would be even nicer if they made a ruggedized version with extended battery life; I'm thinking of spending another $99 and buying a Morphie case with a built-in battery.

I would have also like to see Apple provide better tools for importing data from an older technology cell phone. The use of the nano-SIM means that this was the first phone I has where I couldn't simply slide the card out of one phone and into the next. It also means that I can't quickly switch to a back-up phone if this one suffers a failure and needs repair or replacement.

So yes, an impressive phone and impressive technology. But not quite as practical as I'd hoped.

Two week Update:

As the novelty has work off, and I'm no longer checking it every few minutes just because of the novelty of it all, I find that the battery life is much better than I'd thought as first. But I'm still keeping a charger at bedside, a charging cord in my car, and a small back-up battery in my parka. I'm also finding more useful apps for it- even after having used an iPod Touch and an iPad for years. In fact, I'm starting to realize tha Apple has now successfully locked me into the iPhone.... forever. Sneaky, Apple. Very sneaky.","4.0 out of 5 stars"

However, Apple discriminates against products not bought from the iTunes store.  For example, an audio book bought from iTunes can be backed up to the iTunes library on one's PC.  Not so with an Audible book downloaded with the Audible app.  So far, I have not found any way to back it up into the iTunes audiobook library on my PC.

In addition, Apple seems to use my cellular data on a daily basis to upload about half a megabyte (think of a 100,000 word term paper's worth of data) daily, even when I have turned off push notifications, Siri, location services, and just about everything else.  The only thing that stops this upload is turning off wifi and cellular data.  So much for  having a ""smartphone""!

Then there's the matter of ""garbage collection"".  When one loads something onto the phone and later deletes it, the storage doesn't seem to become available.  One has to back up the phone and restore it in order to have that storage amount available again.

And, then there are the bugs.  Sometimes the backup and restore fails to restore the photo album.  Other times, it fails to restore the ringtones.  And, if you manage to change the setting for manually dealing with music, a restore might try to load all your audiobooks onto the iPhone.  The only thing that gets this to stop may be to restore to factory settings, and then to manually add back everything.","1.0 out of 5 stars"

I cannot wait any longer, because my friend  back to China soon (Seller knows that). Then, I told seller, even this is a new phone, it is in an unsealed box, it is not worth $680. Then, seller just ask me to return the phone to them and indicates that they do not want to talk about this anymore. As the same reason, I cannot wait any long. In the end, I have to take this phone.

None of my over one dozen other devices capable of taking pictures ever had any problems like that even remotely, a picture is a picture. After a brief search on the internet the only solution is to install and run the pictures through external programs to correct it, which of course is time consuming and very annoying. Now I wonder what other surprises are lurking around in the iPhone to slap the unsuspecting in the face.

I wanted the 5 (nice discount and I like the look of the black metal rather than the colored plastic of the 5c) but they were sold out. The store I was at happened to have 1 black (space grey) 16g left so I decided to go for it.
I was upgrading from the 4s which I still think is a great phone. The 4g/LTE capabilities of the 5s are really great, the larger screen is also really great, but other than that the extras that are 5s exclusive are more of a gimmick at this point. The fingerprint sensor is a nice touch but not a necessity as your phone could still get hijacked. It does work pretty well and I like that you can program up to 5 fingerprints (I have thumb and index for both hands programmed on mine as well as the 4 digit pin) the camera is definitely better in low light, but I don't know of the dual flash actually makes a difference for me that is noticeable. The slow motion video camera is fun but I wish you could do more than one section in slow mo (can decide which section is slow mo but can't split it up. You also can't post slow mo to Instagram which is what I use video for mostly. Haven't tried with vine)
I mean, don't get me wrong, it's a nice phone and definitely a notable upgrade from the 4s, but I would've definitely rather had more space on the 5 for the same price or waited for the 6 (supposedly going to have a larger screen.) But if you're an apple fan and due for an upgrade it is a really nice device and you'll probably be happy. I wouldn't upgrade from a 5 though. The biggest thing I care about is this phone has the dependability I have come to expect from Apple (the main reason I switched back to iphone from the buggy android incarnations I was experiencing a couple years ago) and of course the resale value is higher with apple devices later on. So overall it is a good phone and I'm happy with it, but the exclusive upgrades may or may not be worth it depending on what you're looking for.","5.0 out of 5 stars"

Definitely fits the bill for most people that need it for basic smartphone functionality such as email, internet browsing, social networking and light gaming. I personally love the build quality, and it's definitely on par with several of the other phones out there like the HTC one. The screen size is OK, I think it's not too big so you can use it with one hand comfortably but at the same time I wouldn't use it to watch videos out of preference. So, if you want a bigger screen, look elsewhere or wait for the iPhone 6. The specs may seem pretty outdated but it never feels that way when using the phone. Everything is fluid and pleasant to use, I really like the slow-motion feature in the camera as well as the quality of the camera itself, especially under low-lighting conditions. The dual LED flash actually provides for pretty natural looking low-light shots and I would say the camera is easily one of the best I have used on a smartphone period.

That said, the phone does have some moderate to major shortcomings, with the biggest one being Battery-Life. The phone will barely last you the day on a single charge with moderate to light use and relatively less use of 4G or 3G data. Again as mentioned before, the screen size could definitely be bigger. And another major issue is the accuracy of the touch ID sensor. It works great initially, when you first set it up but seems to become rather slow and dumb with passage of time and you may have to reset the settings for it to gain optimal functionality again.

Now for the power users, Yes it can get work done and pretty well too. Graphic intense apps and games run without any problems whatsoever and the user experience is very smooth and fluid, albeit slightly buggy at times. But the biggest put off for power users is the battery-life. The battery would probably give out on you before the CPU or GPU ever will and that's a huge detouring factor for possible power users.

In a nutshell, If you want to use a phone for long periods of gaming, or graphic intensive processing I would say look elsewhere but if you just need a smartphone to just be a smartphone and give you a pleasurable user experience, I would say this is the phone for you!","4.0 out of 5 stars"

I currently own all of their new products but have never had an iPhone intel now. I bought my Gold 64 gb iPhone 5s and waited a few weeks for it to come to my local verizon wireless store.

I mean ya, fingerprint censor...that's great and all but not that useful. Who cares that you save 3 seconds pressing your finger to a button instead of typing in a password. The system with the A7 chip runs faster and more efficiently and siri has been upgraded but I believe they should have brought in more physical features to differentiate the 5s from the 5.

The sellers must specify which phone you are buying.........as Apple DOES NOT SELL ANY UNLOCKED iPhone. What they sell is the T-mobile with NO CONTRACT phone, which is LOCKED. An Apple rep told me that if you decide to buy this phone, you will have to buy a $50 prepaid card (minimum) in order to use the phone and after 40 days you will have to go to a T-mobile rep to unlock it for you. So any new iPhone 5S sold as ""new"" or sealed.......will not be unlocked. BUYERS BEWARE!","2.0 out of 5 stars"

In 2010 I switched over to an Android phone. I was happy with them.... but, something about the iPhone 5S caught my attention, and now that I'm back, I LOOOOOVE IT! One of the things that I really like is the fingerprint use on the home button. It has a really good battery, for me. And I'm on my phone, all the time.

One of my only complaints is that you can't use an app, like Zedge, to add ringtones to your phone. That's a huge deal, for me... and one of the things that really makes missing my Android phones a little bit more.","4.0 out of 5 stars"

I had to wait as it was on back order.  My excitement turned to frustration within a day and I had the phone returned within 3 days.  This new phone would NOT recognize my finger touch.  I would have to try over and over--sometimes twenty times to get the phone to respond.  Sometimes, even then, it would not.  I contacted Verizon, my cell provider and was told my hands were too cold for the screen to respond.  I was told to purchase special gloves with something in the finger tips or a stylus as large around as a marker and as long as the phone to use for everything on the screen.  I was told there was no case available to store the phone and stylus, so I was to try to keep them together or not be able to use my phone.  Alternately, I could wear special gloves, day and night.  I am older.  I do have chronically cold hands (inside and out) and live in a currently cold upper Midwest state.  I had my spouse try the phone, with somewhat better results, but never on the first try.  My son tried it, he had better results, but not perfect.  I was told by Verizon, it was me, not the phone and many people with cold hands had trouble with smartphones.  The fingerprint reader did not usually work either (maybe 1 time out of 10), even though it said my print was captured and I put in 4 different finger prints.  I was told by Verizon that no smartphone would work for me.  There was nothing wrong with the phone.  There was no other solution.  I should just use a flip phone.  I made a call to Apple after the phone was returned.  They said they never heard of the cold hand touch screen response problem.  I am so disappointed and upset that there seems to be no solution.  Otherwise, I think this phone was pretty and might have had some nice features.  But, if I can't make a simple phone call in an emergency--what good is anything else?  Any ideas folks?  Thanks!","2.0 out of 5 stars"

Update: I am changing the rating to 4 stars because we were able to use the device on AT&T. Still skeptical however that the phone was shipped the way it was, pre-registered to Verizon even though I would have intended it to be bare bones. The device works great under AT&T LTE and all, just a few minor scratches on the back but not sure if it was from my mother or shipped that way so can't take off for that.","4.0 out of 5 stars"

I think it is simply wrong, let me get this straight, if the quality of the product is so-so, people will never buy it again, I am sure the majority of the people are not just a smart ass poser!!
I've using Apple products for years. No, I am not a die hard fan, I just know that their quality is far superior compared to others, as you can see, other products try their best to compete with iPhone and still, they are number one, in my opinion.
I love the simple, sleek, smart, sophisticated and elegant design. Mine is gold color, it looks and feels luxurious.
This phone delivers a slim but spacious screen, improved wireless speeds, better camera autofocus, and bumped-up storage capacities. iOS remains a top-notch mobile operating system with an excellent ecosystem of apps, and Apple Pay is a smooth, secure payment system.
The bottom line is it is an exceptional phone in nearly every way except its average battery life: it's thin, fast, and features the excellent iOS operating system. I am happy with this product","5.0 out of 5 stars"

Apple only releases one iPhone each year so I had to act quickly to get my hands on one, especially the gold color since supplies went to China first. Nerveless, I was able to get my hands on the 32-gigabyte gold iPhone model for $299 on contract with AT&T.

I had upgraded from the iPhone 5 so I was familiar with the design and features but customers who are upgrading from older generation devices will be rather surprised with its results. The gold color is a nice touch since its new, but once a case covers it the color is unnoticeable. If you decide to use the device naked, the gold color differentiates the 5s from the 5 greatly.

Apple's Touch ID, the fingerprint sensor, is a cool feature but to me it does not appeal. As of now its use is limited to unlocking the device, signing into your apple account to make purchases, and store five prints, but the potential is great. Developers could soon utilize this feature and incorporate it into their apps or games to make them more exciting.

The 120 fps feature on the 5s's camera is a great way to show off action shots in slow motion to friends and family. The camera quality is OK but needs to be upgraded from the iPhone 5. The upgraded duel flash is a great improvement from previous generation iPhones, particularly in dark conditions. In addition, Apple's new A7 chip allows for faster responses on iOS 7. Apps that require more power such as iMovie can run faster on the 5s compared to the 5, which takes longer to export data.

Apple says the iPhone 5s is five times as fast as the iPhone 5, but my speed and responsiveness tests confirm it is actually twice as fast. The 64-bit architecture allows faster apps to run on the 5s, but compatible apps on the App Store are limited since its ""new"" technology.

In all, if you are available for an upgrade, the iPhone 5s is worth it from an older generation device such as an iPhone 4 or 4s. If the 5s's new features appeal to you, upgrading to the 5s is not a bad choice either, especially with the new technology. Additional warranties are offered from Apple to protect the device, but a simple case can prevent uncertain accidents from happening for years to come.

Pictures are crisper on the S5. Google voice is far better than Siri - reads your voice consistently on searches and reacts instantly. The screen size alone is a huge advantage for any video and email. The iPhone would not sync both my emails - hotmail would not work. On the S5, it's conveniently within the same tab and lightning quick. The iPhone would work poorly with WiFi through my TWC wireless modern and on 3G, often locking up.

When I first upgraded from the 4s to the 5s, I was absolutely amazed be the performance enhancements, from data speed (4G LTE instead of 3G) to the great materials and small improvements like the fingerprint sensor and camera. Unfortunately, I had a problem with the battery life. I was using the phone for about 1 and a half hours almost straight on the internet, starting at around 95% battery life and ended up with 5% at the end. According to Apple, I should be getting 8-10 hours. Looking into this problem online, I saw that this was a somewhat common problem.

I decided to go to one of Apple's stores to talk to the ""Genius Bar"" about the problem. They ran a program and said there was no problem with it. We talked to a manager to hopefully get a better understanding and they said that a lot of apps were running in the background (multitasking) and that I should update to the latest version of iOS 7 (I was at the version before the most recent one). I can understand why those two things would take up some battery life, but am I really supposed to believe it changes by almost 90% just because of that? I don't think so. As of right now, I haven't tested it again, but I plan to write an update to this review in case it does get better.

Overall, the performance of the phone is great, but until I can get the battery working as it should, I will be disappointed with it.","3.0 out of 5 stars"

I moved on from my iphone 4s and knew i wanted to stay in the apple family. I decided on the 5S because I wanted the upgraded performance rather than the 5C. It did not disappoint. I've had the phone for close to a year now and it still runs like it is brand new. While most phones go through everyday wear and tear this phone has held up very well. I feel the battery life is better than people I know that have android phones. The upgraded processors make the phone lightning fast. Another feature I like is the screen. The display is very clear and easy to see in all lights. The most well know feature of the 5S is the new fingerprint technology and it works very well for its first release. Most times it works perfectly and other times it takes a couple tries. I love the iphone 5S and would recommend it for anyone.","5.0 out of 5 stars"

I have other Apple products. I'm not a head over heels Apple fan, but I do appreciate and am usually very satisfied with the Apple products I have.

When the iPhone 5 came out, I didn't feel that it the upgraded features were enough to spend on the upgrade. There were definitely features that were better than the 4s, but again, I don't need to get the new Apple iPhone just because it's new. However, given the speed claims on the 5s along with the bigger screen than the 4s and touch ID and LTE, I decided to go for it. Regardless of speed claims, when I received the phone and started using it, the speed increase was huge! the bigger screen is very nice to have. Seems like a good size to me (I'm not sold on the size of bigger phones). Even with the length increase it still feels good in your hand. The camera upgrades and LTE are great and not much more is needed to say on that.

On the touch ID, it's gotten more hype than I feel it deserves. I've never use a passcode on my phone, because I hated putting it in every time I got into my phone. I use my phone extensively so it was enough that I left it off. However, having the Touch ID has made it much easier to have more security on my phone. It rarely works if your finger is remotely wet. The nicest feature of the Touch ID is not having to put in the password when I buy apps. Not having to enter my password makes it much more convenient without losing security. Overall, it's a nice feature, but it needs a bit of work to make it truly efficient. Nothing out of the ordinary for a first time feature.

The feature I like about this phone is that it just works and it works well. There's not a lot of customization that you could get with Android phones, but it's nice to know that what it does, it does well. Also having other products, it's a nice way to integrate with other Apple products. You won't regret getting this phone!","5.0 out of 5 stars"

Overall I prefer the iPhone over the others and would recommend it, with a few minor reservations.

The iPhone 5s is superior in these areas:

1. The design is a work of art, finely sculpted and proportioned; a pleasure to hold and use

2. The screen is fantastic; big enough to be really useful but small enough for the phone to be easily pocketable. The Blackberry screen was maybe too small for most applications except for email, and the Android too big and heavy for portable use. I particularly like the long narrow screen on the 5s

3. A lot of thought has gone into the way a user can navigate around the screen through the different functions. I have owned an iPod Touch for a couple of years and have become a fan of Apple's clear and simple graphics: on the 5s, it's even better. The software never crashes, which it did with both my Android phones frequently

4. For a user with larger than average hands/fingers, the on-screen keypad of the 5s is really well designed - especially true if you use the phone in landscape format which has the effect of widening the keypad. In comparison, the Android was frustrating and not very user-friendly and the Blackberry Storm completely hopeless - though the permanent keypad on the Curve was great

5. The ring tone & speaker volume is louder and clearer on the iPhone than any of its rivals

6. Phone reception is the best. I don't know how Apple manage this, but I have made and received calls in locations where other phones don't seem to work  - like travelling on the London underground and in deep underground car parks

7. The camera is so good it's up to the standard of a dedicated Canon or Nikon compact, for the first time on a cellphone

8. The memory (64GB) is vast, with a storage capacity so huge you're never likely to need more no matter what you download and store on it

9. Siri, iMessage and Facetime are genuinely useful apps, not just gimmicks. They actually work well. The fingerprint scanner works too, though how much of a real security feature this is remains doubtful

Gripes: very few -

1. The battery life isn't great, but no worse than the Android Galaxy 4 and you can substantially improve it on the 5s by turning off power-hungry applications

2. The unique nano-SIM means you can't swap the SIM over to another phone in an emergency, or for example if the phone is damaged and needs repair

3. The price of the 5s is a bit steep, but here you really do get what you pay for

Overall I have become a reluctant Apple convert. It's easy to see why they have become market leader with such an excellent product. Of course in another 2 or 3 years the tech will have moved on again, there may be a new market-leading manufacturer and the 5s will be an antique. But until then, the 5s for me is the King of cellphones.

Finally, a lot of one-star reviews posted on amazon are from buyers griping about having been shipped locked phones by online sellers. This must be very frustrating but these are not really product reviews, they are complaints about the seller. The solution is easy: buy from an Apple store and they'll set up the new iPhone for you and transfer all the data from your old phone.","5.0 out of 5 stars"

APPLE has programmed the iOS so that all messages, inbound and outbound, including attachments, are saved on the phone with absolutely no option, within the OS, to delete them.
Sure, they let the user THINK they have deleted the messages and attachments, but a quick dive into the phone's list of memory hogs shows that the MESSAGES app is taking up more and more space every day.
If you enjoy sending and receiving pictures and videos via message, every time you do, it deletes from your available memory with no option, within the OS, to recover the memory that was just used.
Now some people, in the conspiracy world, may think that this is a way for your personal messages to be recovered or spied on.... But I think the reason is more insidious. They don't care about your messages. They care if you buy another phone and buy one sooner and buy one with MORE memory because they cost MORE. And, yes, that new, more-memory, more expensive I-phone is going to experience the same memory choking end.
Yes, I have confirmed that Apple is aware and has been aware of this ""problem"" and that they have been aware of it through the release of one iOS after another. Considering the logical ease of programming the ability to actually delete a file and recover memory, (we do it all of the time when we take photos off the phone) it's a logical conclusion that APPLE wants this included in the design of the phone.
It's highway Robery It's unethical. It's grounds for a class-action lawsuit.
And it's why I would never buy another one.
Extra note about the 5s: (and APPLE is also aware if this one... And has no plans to fix it.): the power button is seated in such a way that it rattles. It may not sound like a big deal when you first hear it. It's a light tapping. But, the way the button is designed, pill shaped and curved on each end, when you are taking a video, the button teeters within the case portal and rattles. To the ear, it sounds like nothing. On the video it sounds like garbage cans being hammered on.
Apple's response is that ""it is not a defect. It is a ""feature"". It was designed for those people who accidentally dunk their phone in soda or coffee. If they do, this special metal button won't stick""
I've actually talked to a few APPLE ""geniuses"" who read this prepared response to me. Ingenious! Call a defect a ""feature"" and avoid a recall.
So, there is my sincere review of the iPhone 5s.
I cannot suggest a different phone because I have no idea if the other companies are resorting to the same nasty tactic. If I learn more, I will update this post.","3.0 out of 5 stars"

I gave up the IPhone 4 for this one and regret it almost every day. The finger print scanner only seems to work for a few hours before I have to input a new phone. I added my daughters and my wife so they could unlock it and none of their finger prints work now either. I add my almost everyday and by the end of the day it will not recognize my finger print.

The keypad is a nightmare. As I said I have had IPhones before. This one is so sensitive (and I have fat fingers) that I can never get a message out without getting a cap rather than an ""a"" and/or several other mistakes that autocorrect invariably screws up. Never had that problem so regularly on other phones.

I have not had Siri before but it is worthless on my phone. I have used voice recognition programs on my computers and never had problems there so I have a hard time imagining it is my voice but most of the time I cannot get Siri to work well enough to use it.

All in all this phone is a nightmare but maybe it is a lemon.","1.0 out of 5 stars"

To use it only as a phone is a bit like living in the Taj Mahal when all you really need is a tent. I've only had the iPhone for three days, and it's my first. This review will therefore be from a new-user's point of view and without reference to the competition. In other words, what it's like to live with an iPhone 5s.

The presentation of the phone, with its exquisite Zen-like packaging, builds the anticipation, until finally the waiting's over and there it is: looking and feeling like a bar of gold or precious metal, its solidity and weight are somehow reassuring. The harmony in the architectonics is a triumph of aesthetics, and that's without even switching it on. But before you do that, you'll be required to fit your nano sim card. Using the pin supplied, this requires the dexterity and sensitivity of a concert pianist matched with the optical facility of an eagle, but once done you're ready to fire it up.

If you already have other Apple devices you'll find your phone exchanging data straightaway, with your contacts, photos etc being ported over the airwaves. There's relatively little to do in the way of set-up as most of it appears to happen automatically. You can then personalise the phone even further, first with the famous finger-print. This involves (as does so much from now on) in going into Settings. Choose Touch ID and after rolling your digit around on the Home button, the sensor registers your details, and from then on opening up the screen is quick and easy, plus you can use it in the ITunes store. If you can't decide whether you'll be using your finger or your thumb then why not register both, and if you want to allow anyone else access to the phone then they can add their fingerprint too. An extra precaution of a numerical passcode is required to access your credit card information. Once set, this also transfers to other devices, meaning you never have to manually fill in an internet payment form again.

I have the 16GB model, and possibly some juggling might be required in deleting and later re-loading apps/photos/downloaded songs on Spotify, but that doesn't look as though it'll be a problem for some time, as at the moment there's 11GB free. What might be an issue however is data allowance from your provider; I seem to have got through 100MB already, and that's only in a couple of days. It might be best then to choose a contract with an unlimited data allowance if you are going to want to make the most of the iPhone's entertainment value.

Navigating around the phone is intuitive enough, the Home button being the key to changing between apps. Double-click this and it will bring up all of your open applications, which is often a clearer way of orienting yourself. A swipe upwards reveals the torch (which is very powerful), the calculator, the timer and camera, as well as Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Do Not Disturb shortcuts, plus your music player. A downward swipe within an app displays your schedule. A downward swipe on the Homescreen brings up the search facility, which can be used with confidence. Siri, the slightly surreal footman character can be activated by bringing the phone up to your ear. Using its mystifying powers, Siri can then find the way to the nearest Tandoori or be grilled for the sum of 4.3339 + 2.7, its seemingly inexhaustible knowledge providing hours of amusement. If Siri can't solve your problem directly it'll find references on the web which should provide you with an answer.

YouTube and iPlayer are rendered in a crystalline clarity and the dimensions of the 5s give a panoramic quality to the theatre. The sound is remarkably full, and the earphones supplied seem excellent. Photos are catalogued in Years, drilling down to Collections and then Moments which sounds overly complicated but is actually coherent in use and quick to comprehend. The quality as you'd expect, is uniformly excellent and the new flash arrangement leads to an enhanced quality in poor light.

From then on the sky really does seem to be the limit, with apps for just about every conceivable occasion. In short, the iPhone is a device which you possibly never knew you needed, but once you've lived with it for a few hours, it's hard to imagine life without.","5.0 out of 5 stars"

A cell phone is a fashion icon and a result of great engineering and design. It is more a computer than fits in the palm of your hand. The new iPhone 5s from Apple is a vast improvement in all aspects when compared to the older iPhone 4s. For consumers looking for a new iPhone, the 5s does everything the 4s did but with an even bigger convenience while still looking elegant and being ergonomic.
Apple works meticulously to design their products and misses no detail. The 5s is no exception. With a design that just feels natural in your hand considering its size and weight. It is much thinner and lighter than the 4s so it just feels even better than before. It is slightly taller but it is so miniscule that only when comparing will you be able to notice the difference. The aluminum material used in the bezel provides a feeling of a very sturdy phone and the small weight of the phone. The design is not the only thing that makes the iPhone a good phone but more the other aspects.
There is an improvement in screen size from the iPhone 4s. The 4s, had a 3.5 inch screen and the 5s packs a 4 inch screen but just increasing the height of the device but a small bit. The .5 inch improvement might not seem like much on paper but it adds a whole section of more viewing experience. We get one extra row of icons, which will de-clutter the phones home screen. Once having the 5s and experiencing the change you will never want to go back to the 4s.
When wanting to do something whether you're in a hurry or just sitting relaxing, you will always want you phone to run fast. In todays world we are used to instant gratification when we want to do something and the iPhone 5s provides just that. The 5s, provides a new processor called the A7 chip, another huge improvement over the iPhone 4s, A5 chip. The A7 gives the iPhone 5s a smooth experience and will never lag when doing tasks. Opening an app takes less than a second after opening the app. It also provides a better video and picture viewing due to the new and faster processor. Images taken with the 5s will even look better since the phone processes images with more power and speed. Phone calls and text messages are a must on any phone and these days the quality and speed of them are up to par.
If those improvements aren't enough, then maybe this feature will convince you. Putting in your passcode every single time you use your phone can become a hassle and when wanting to access the phone really quick, this can become an annoyance. Apple has implemented a new sensor in the phone called Touch ID, this is integrated into the home button so nothing big has changed other then the ability to access the phone with your fingerprint. The process of the phone recognizing your finger and letting you inside the phone is almost instant and is so accurate that it will never mistaken someone else's finger with yours. This feature is also accessible when wanting to buy a song or app from the app store. Instead of imputing your password when you want to buy something, just set your finger on the button and before you know it, it will be downloading.
The iPhone also has `industry leading' camera optics and it is said that the best camera is the one that you will always have with you. Combining those, the iPhone 5s is also the best camera out there. With an increased image sensor from the 4s, the iPhone 5s will capture all the colors that you see and capture it beautifully and with great clarity with its 8MP camera. The video the iPhone 5s captures is 1080p with great sounding audio. A cool feature of the camera is that it features a slow-motion video at 120 frames per second.
For people who want a phone that does the basics and then goes beyond while still looking amazing, get the iPhone 5s. It offers amazing features that you will actually use. If the carefully designed body of the iPhone is not enough than maybe the increase in screen size will. The phone is much fast than the iPhone 4s, has the fingerprint reading capability for unlocking, and offers amazing picture quality. The iPhone sales for $199 with 2 years contract and overall the iPhone 5s is an amazing phone that will not leave you asking the question, ""Why doesn't it do this?""","5.0 out of 5 stars"
