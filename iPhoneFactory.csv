This is my 2nd iPhone , coming from an iPhone 5.
I'm an Apple enthusiast so this was an obvious choice for me.

It is fast opening and closing apps, websites, etc. but not a huge difference to make me suggest to hurry up and buy it.
I only got an iPhone 6 because my daughter was in need of her first iPhone, so it made sense to give her my old iPhone 5.
The screen response is perfect and the thumb print works 100% of the time and is really convenient to get into the phone.","5.0 out of 5 stars"

And well I definitely miss my GS5. I'm not saying iPhone isn't a good phone; it just isn't Amazing. It is fluid, solid; but basic. Great for older adults who aren't very tech savvy. I feel as though I switched from a Benz to a top of the line Toyota lol iTunes and the finger print scanner are awesome. I mean it's instant! Much better than S5. However; not many features for camera. No split screen for multi-tasking; which I used very much on my GS5. Email seems to have not progressed for Apple. I can compare because I've had iPads. It is just very generic. Sound quality while talking is a bit muffled. No option to decrease volume of touch sounds without decreasing volume of phone overall. These are things I've noticed after having this phone for 2 weeks. Maybe I'll learn to love it over the next 2 years.","3.0 out of 5 stars"

First, comparing the two is apples to oranges, big differences. This specific apple device is to my liking because of 64 gigs that were available (ridiculous space, in a good way), and the fact that it is as slim as my previous Android devices. Lets take a look at the good, the bad, and the honesty.

Pros
1. Tons of Space
2. Lightest phone I've ever had
3. quick reaction when I flick the screen
4. awesome fingerprint ID scan technology (can use multiple fingers, or your fingers and others fingers)
5. Solid, needs a case though
6. Great speakerphone (for all you who drive plenty)

Cons
1. Harder to access customizability (meaning that android is more open source and you can tinker with it) but apple is getting better.
2. Easy to crack front screen (c'mon, get a case already)
3. Font camera is okay, but the back one is great!!!
4. Silver is nice, but I would have preferred an all white phone.

This phone is a great buy, I am on a payment plan with mine because of the price, but it is doable!
Overall, it is worth it. The reaction time is quick, its more smooth in its hardware than most phones. The updates are roughly once a month now, but it speeds up the phone and adds newer technology, that is a plus!","5.0 out of 5 stars"

Their ipod classic and ipad both perform music pretty well.","1.0 out of 5 stars"

Unlike previous phones that were objectified to certain age groups (i.e. sliding-keyboard phones) the iPhone completely shattered this barrier. In the earliest stages of the iPhone legacy, only a few more fortunate people were allowed this luxury of limitless Internet usage. Fast forward a handful of generations to the current iPhones and the data plans that make it relatively affordable for the casual phone enthusiast can enjoy the benefits of the device.

Some of the criteria I used in reviewing this product were durability, customization, general appeal and interface. Overall this product exceeded my expectations and I would certainly recommend it to a friend.

Durability: For anyone who is used to iPhones, you know this is a sophisticated piece of technology and shouldn’t be subjected to ample amounts of abuse. The entire phone is made out of the highest quality of aluminum; compared to the glass and plastic body’s we have seen in the past. The home key however is replaced with a glass insert; it goes without saying that the front of the screen will shatter if it lands face down on something hard.

Customization: A very large issue from people who are thinking about making the switch from Android platforms is this category in particular. The home screen on the iPhone is very professional and simple. There is always the option to “Jail Hack” the Phone but I must warn you it sometimes will void the warranty.

General Appeal: This Phone is very large if you are making the switch from the iPhone 5 model. To some this may be a weird transition but after you see the quality of the screen you wont be complaining about the HD video streaming capabilities. The overall button layout has the same setup, with the exception of the lock button. This has been relocated to the right side of the phone; this has proven to be a very handy feature.

Interface: I have been frequently asked when trying to convince my friends to come over to Apple why it is better. Simply put, that is the interface. To me this is one of the reasons I am loyal to this brand. Compared to android that has a thousand different models to try and come up with software updates, apple only has to make a few general updates to the masses.

Jumping on the Apple bandwagon might be one of the best things you do for yourself this year. The simple layout of the iPhone, similar to other Apple products, might be so simple it’s confusing at first. However this will drastically pay off when you are able to navigate in a breeze.","5.0 out of 5 stars"

My first iPhone was the 4S and I had it for a couple of years. I never had one single problem with it. Then I ended up getting the Galaxy Note II when it first hit the market. It was like climbing out of a Bentley and getting into a Volkswagen.

The fluidity of the overall function of the iPhone from navigating anywhere within the phone as well as its speed cannot be matched. When I went Android I lost all of that. True Apple lovers know what I'm talking about. The speed and fluidity of Apple products can't be touched! I was floored.

After 3 years of lugging around a phone I never cared to even really learn how to use, I got the iPhone 6 and never looked back. As a matter of fact, the only bad thing I can say about this phone is that I wanted black and ended up with a gray one. But that really doesn't matter!","5.0 out of 5 stars"

However, the audio function was a problem from the first call I made. It was impossible to hear the caller nor could I speak to the caller. This was true in the both iPhone and speaker function. Because of the audio issue, the phone is unable to record voice messages or shoot videos with any audio recorded. Additionally, the iPhone 6 has also shut down on its own several times without any prompting. You can imagine my frustration when I'm unable to hear or speak to my friends, family and business associates.

Arriving had the unfortunate surprise to discover that it is LOCKED.
Do not understand what happened because the specifications of the product and according to the almost $ 800 price was clear that this was an unlocked product.

Now I have a cell blocked by AT & T operator, which does not work here in Brazil.

I paid $ 800 for an unlocked cell phone while a locked cost me only 200.

To unlock my phone here in Brazil I have to pay a fee, but I know of no reliable place to make it unlocked.

After unboxing my phone and running through the normal procedure of getting my info into it, I noticed the screen made a popping noise. I could literally push the screen in about a millimeter.

I scheduled an appointment with Apple and they took a look at it with their team of geniuses and concluded that it was within normal operation. I told them that having a loose screen is a bad design and the guy actually scoffs at me, and says, ""for what? A mere millimeter of movement?""

So, come to find out, this is a known issue and it will not be resolved any time soon. It's considered ""normal"". Go ahead and Google loose screen iphone 6. I'm not the first and won't be the last.

This IPhone 6 is the best yet. The previous IPhone I had before mine now was the 5th generation which was great, but the 6 has been drastically improved.
Features:
The IPhone 6 is a great size and shape. It comfortably fits in my hand and pocket while I’m not using it.  The weight is very well balanced and distributed through the phone perfectly. The phone’s screen is very large, and it makes using the product very easy. The screen has a very high resolution, even better than the previous IPhone 5. The phone seems to be very durable although I almost always have a case on it, and the case tends to take most of the blow if I drop it.
$600:
I think this product was well worth the price. It is extremely useful when I’m not home. It has tons of different useful products in it like a flashlight, calculator, compass, and the internet.

EXPECTATIONS?
 This IPhone went well above my expectations. I was a big fan of the previous IPhone, so I was expecting a lot.  Before I got my phone, I wasn’t sure if the 6 could meet my expectations; it definitely did.  Apple did a great job creating this product!
WHO WOULD USE THIS PRODUCT?
 I think people of all ages could benefit from this product. This is an easy to use product which would make it good for people who are not quite up to date with new technology, typically older people. This simple product could also be great for kids.
OVERALL:
 The IPhone 6 is an amazing product that  I bring most places with places me. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone looking for a new phone.","5.0 out of 5 stars"

I have been an apple products owner before buying an iPhone 6 and this product is one of my favorites that apple has to offer!

Apple has increased their personal applications, like their health app, I love their health app because it tracks how many steps you have taken and you even have the option of adding your body measurements, what fitness you have completed that day and what you have eaten as well to track your calories. The iPhone 6 has another personal app called a Medical ID, you can put your information in from what your birthday is to if you are an organ donor. This app option shows up on the lock screen and is accessible even if somebody doesn't have your passcode to unlock your phone. This app is very helpful in emergency situations and Androids don't have this feature.

The main applications that this phone have make life a lot easier. iMessage is so much faster and more convenient. I couldn't go back to an Android or any other phone after using iMessage. As well as, FaceTime, another application that only an iPhone has. Using FaceTime while I'm away at college has made communicating with my family and friends a lot more fun and easier.

The larger style of the iPhone 6 verse the iPhone 4, 5, 5c, or 5s makes the phone easier to handle. Also, the cosmetics of the phone are original to the iPhone, but still have a lot of fun and stylish options. The new slender and sleek style of the iPhone is lightweight. The design makes it easier when you're a busy college student and always on the go to just put it in your pocket or bag.

Overall, the phone is a great addition to the iPhone collection. Not only for college students, but also anybody who is familiar and loves Apple products. Apple does a great job of keeping some of their wonderful trademarks of the iPhone, but also adding new and improved features to please everybody.","5.0 out of 5 stars"

This may sound astounding to you as it was to me but iTunes is one of the worst music software or general software application that exists.  Portable music devices is what really put Apple over the top the last decade.  So you'd imagine iTunes would just work like it's supposed to.  You'd be surprised how bad it is if you're switching over from Android music services such as Amazon Music.  I've had most of my music collection on Amazon Music.  Switching to Apple I thought it would be as easy as subscribing to iTunes Match and pushing my collection to iTunes cloud.  Not so simple.  Using iTunes on my pc it failed to recognize more than half of my mp3s.  Apparently, this is a known issue with users complaining on the Apple support forums about how poor the matching software is.  It's slow when it works but most of the time it doesn't.  In comparison, Amazon Music matching is a breeze.  the quality of the code is superior.  Now when you subscribe to iTunes Match you're supposed to get iTunes Radio without commercials.  All I ever got was commercials on the iPhone and iTunes on PC.  So this is a backend problem not necessarily tied to a device.  The iTunes interface on iPhone is just horrible.  The Music app to play your music is also horrible.  The user experience is lacking with little update or innovation over the last several years.

The biggest problem with iTunes is that it's not an AppStore application but tightly integrated with iOS release.  I'd imagine iTunes upgrades and enhancements would be markedly improved if it was separated out as it's own App Store app.  There's little likelihood this will happen anytime soon, however, as there appears to be a monetary reason behind this intentional tightly coupled integration.  When you use apps like Shazaam or SoundHound and intend to purchase a track you can only do so thru iTunes.  That's also a drag.  You can't purchase from, say, Amazon Music (android users know you can purchase tracks from any music provider on the platform).  For apple to continue their music monopoly on IOS they have to package the music services as part of their platform, that there are technical reasons why they can't open up their platform to 3rd party music purchasing services.  Therein lies their own demise of their music platform. There's little incentive to innovate.  What's odd even still is how anti-trust lawsuits haven't surfaced already.  If Microsoft can get slammed for shipping their own browser with their OS, then how is it that Apple can go unscathed for purposely limiting customers freedom to choose their music provider?

IOS is pretty good in general.  It's definitely better than Android or a linux hacked OS.  It's better quality software in general and I like the fact the hardware doesn't get hung up in some deadlock.  I can almost always escape some kind of software locking through the home button which seems to force a hardware interrupt.  It's a better system software for sure.  iTunes and it's supporting software, however, is pure crap.  Thumbs up if you think this review will help anyone else make their switch over from android.","3.0 out of 5 stars"

They moved the main screen on-off button to the side, opposite of the volume buttons.  Every single time I press it, I have to contort my fingers to keep from hitting the volume, too.  Talk about stupid design.  And with the hard case on it, it actually hurts my fingers every single time I have to press that stupid button.

The volume controls are also screwed up.  Changing the volume of an app will affect the volume of phone calls and your alarms.  Watch out, because your alarm will scream at you later.

These are two small problems that are problems EVERY SINGLE TIME I USE THE PHONE.

As one might expect, everything else works pretty well.  There's still no Swype keyboard equivalent built in, which is still stupid, and the autocorrect is still terrible.  But having the apps communicate easily with my MacBook is very useful.  That said, I don't think the increase in screen size was worth it, either.  It's still too small to comfortably play more of the complicated game apps I'd hoped it could handle better; I still stick to my iPad Mini for most games.  Another annoyance is that if you make a recording while you're driving now, because you need a ""note to self"" later, the iPhone doesn't just save it automatically, it forces you to save each and every recording separately and will keep a giant red banner on your phone until you do.  In other words, making notes while driving is no longer the nice, safe no-typing thing it used to be...but, alas, I assume that's an ""upgrade"" that would affect all phones.  I love Mac, but this is all stupid.

All in all, every single day I wish I hadn't upgraded.  Once my T-Mobile Jump program kicks in, I'll ""upgrade"" back to iPhone 5, if it's still available.","1.0 out of 5 stars"

I had an iPhone 5s before I had this phone and I liked the programs on my iPhone 5s. I was familiar with using the IOS program. Compared to the Android program, I felt the IOS is more convenient to use on a cell-phone.
One day, I was driving and I put my iPhone 5s on my lap instead of my pockets after I answered a call. When I was trying to get out of my car, my iPhone 5s fell on the ground and the screen of the phone was broken. I bought a screen on-line with 70 dollars and I tried to replace a new screen for my iPhone 5s, but I failed. I took it to an Apple store and they told me that they cannot help me fix it because they have a policy that says if we open the iPod product on our own, then the product does not belong to Apple anymore. I was shocked and I had to buy a new iPhone because I did not have a phone to use.
I bought this Phone on Amazon because it was new and it was also a little bit cheaper than the retail price. I liked the gold color on iPhone because I feel it looks more luxurious with the gold color. The new iPhone 6 looks different than iPhone 5s. The iPhone 6 is thinner, wider, and longer compared to the iPhone 5s. The iPhone 6 also weighs less than the 5s. There is also an iPhone 6 plus but I bought the iPhone 6 because I thought the 6 plus was too big.
I like to look up things on my iPhone 6 because it has a bigger screen compared to what I had before. The text is bigger and it is easier now for me to text on my phone. I downloaded a lot of apps on my phone because I like to play with it. I also use the GPS on my iPhone 6 because I like to have road trips. The apps and the GPS on my iPhone 6 are easy to use and very convenient. I bought a glass screen for my new phone because it protects the phone screen. I don’t want to break my phone anymore.","5.0 out of 5 stars"

I was informed that the iPhone 6 I ordered was unlocked so that I would be able to use it on my GSM network. I ordered my iPhone and received it in about 3 business days, which surprised me as I was expecting it to take about a week. Opened up the box and inserted a brand new SIM card. Called my network to have my phone number transferred over. For 3 days I could not get past the activation screen on the phone. I emailed NEXT GEN WIRELESS to ask for a replacement and explain the situation and tell them the phone was locked. I called Apple Customer Support in the meantime to see if there was anything I could do to fix the issue myself. I was informed by Apple Customer Support that the phone was not only LOCKED by a carrier I've never even heard of, but BRICKED (hardware or software issue) meaning the phone was dead and unusable. NEXT GEN WIRELESS finally replied to me and claimed to have spoken with Apple who told them the phone was unlocked. After calling Apple to confirm this, I was told that basically NEXT GEN WIRELESS blatantly lied to me. I demanded a refund and I will NOT order from NEXT GEN WIRELESS again nor will I recommend them to anyone!!","1.0 out of 5 stars"

I'm a Fanboy, yes, but I've tried Android phones. I've given the competition a fair shake. I went from an iPhone 4s to a Samsung Note 2 and then to a Moto X and I was so aggravated by the constant trade-offs that I finally just gave up and went back to Apple. Android devices stuttered when scrolling, didn't create hotspots when I needed them, and inconsistently connected to Bluetooth. Cameras were slow and awkward and you were lucky to get more than one or two OS updates (my Note 2 on T-Mobile never got 4.4). These are things I take for granted on an iPhone.

So why the 1 star? Because Apple never ceases to disgust me with their power adapters. Great phone, horrible horrible cables. No other tablet or phone manufacturer uses a proprietary format and if one or two does, then they don't deliberately sabotage 3rd party adapters to force you into overpriced Apple ones. I needed a 30pin to Lightning adapter to control my iPhone from my car. $40 for the official Apple model. That's like buying HDMI cables at Best Buy. I'm pretty sure there's a chapter in Business 101 that says if you're getting compared to Best Buy, then you're doing something wrong.

Last week I had to drive my wife's Buick. The 3rd party cables that worked in my car could not charge in hers. These same cables worked fine later when connected to my MacBook. So Apple is cool when you're using another manufacturer's cable connected to your Apple computer, but not the USB port in a car? That's just mean.

The worst part is that Apple's got me bent over a barrel. I love their phones. Android phones may be bigger, faster, and have more features, but none provide the consistently I need from my phone. So I'm trapped with a drawer full of Lightning cables that may or may not work when I need them.","1.0 out of 5 stars"

It's a quality product with the user in mind.  The camera and video is amazing.  I am a Scoutmaster for our local Boy Scout troop and use the phone as my main camera. It's easy to transfer and share pictures.  With the ICloud backing up your pictures and videos is very easy and safe. No more worrying about your memories being erased.

The overall processing speed is very fast. With a good Internet connection games and apps are downloaded quickly.  There are millions of useful apps to aid you in any possible hobby and interest you have.

The iPhone 6 has a large screen some using it for banking or Google searches is nice instead of pulling out the bulky computer.  I work on a computer all day so that the last thing I want to grab to perform a quick task.

I don't play many games on my phone but the graphics are very good and no lag time.  I also like how you can restrict in game purchases in the setting menu.  This gives me piece of mind letting my kids play my phone with the fear of seeing my next phone bill.

I love the map and GPS function.  I use it over my other GPS car device.  It's very reliable and it rarely wrong.  The time of arrival is based on legal speed limits but it is very close updates as you are driving.  I would literally be lost without my IPhone maps, I always rely on it now.

The basic text and phone features work great and are easy to use. Apple makes a great product that is users friendly.","5.0 out of 5 stars"

I've had my iPhone 6 for over a month now and although I'm a huge fan of iPhone and I have had them all since they first came out, I am not impressed with this phone. It's just too big. The iPhone 5 was solid and beautiful. The shape and feel of it was perfect. The only problem was battery life. I wish they'd stuck closer to this style and size but made it thicker to last longer.
This new ones feel weak and flimsy and if it didn't have the double tap to bring the top down, I would've returned this and got the 5S. This phone works pretty well but the battery life still sucks and it looks like a Samsung. They also totally screwed up moving the off button from the top to the side so when its in your pocket you cant hit it. I think that Apple may be through now that Jobs is gone...
The only reason I gave 3 stars is because it still has features I love but the design of the this phone is just weak, poorly designed and lacks the beautiful solid designs of the past.","3.0 out of 5 stars"

i have started to use Smartphone with Apple Iphone 2 it was several years ago. Then after some time i have changed to Samsung as it was suposingly offered better ""Details"" i mean it was actuarely hunting after nerds who thinks they are geeks.

So samsung offered a better resoloution camera, bigger storage and ""better"" cpu.

After years using samsung smartphone i can tel you that the Quality of my side of view is way better on Apple iphone even if they have lower Pixel Camera.

i think apple will stay as number one for long period of time because apple stays with better understanding the people needs befor they even know that they have such needs.

i will defently advise any who i know to purchase Apple Products !

Samsung tryed to copy apple many times,  try to out-reach apple products with better cameras, bigger sotrage and quicker cpu.

this is like Cat and Mouse racing, but samsung NEVER catch that hype because of one simple Reason !

Samsung have no strategy what so ever to customers journey and expience of a product.

you can bump up on every piece of sh***t better camera or bigger LCD Disply and name it as you want, but as long you have no customer expirience you will never reach that.

i can say it with 100% safety that all i know people use apple are way cooler then Android / samsung user.

to all thouse who claim to be so geeg, try better Linux Phone i mean with Ubuntu Phone then Samsung, even thouse are way better.","5.0 out of 5 stars"

Before this switch, I've used the Samsung Galaxy S2 (first smartphone ever!) and also the Nexus 4.  Since I'm a tech enthusiast, I'm well versed and have played around with many other Android devices, including all the big names, Galaxy S5, HTC One M8 and M7, One Plus One, and so on.  Here are my thoughts:

Things that the iPhone does really well (both hardware and software-wise):
1. Camera.  The behind the scene software for digitally capturing an image is definitely the strongest sell for the iPhone.  Other than the S5 and Note 4, no smartphone really comes close to having the same kind of image quality (no matter the megapixels) compared to the iPhone.  This was one of the reasons for me to switch over since I've started to dabble with photography and wanted a really good camera in my smartphone.  (Side note, if you read a lot of tech blogs, there is a notion that in the near future our smartphones won't accurately describe our devices anymore since making a phone call is probably one of the least commonly used features on a smartphone when you look at any average user.  Cameras, social media, emails all take a higher usage rate than making a call... really interesting, but anyway, back to the review).

2.  Reliability.  There have been maybe 2 or 3 times when my phone crashed and would have to be restarted, mostly due to playing some game that was not written very well for the iOS devices.  On Android devices, I've experienced a lot more crashes, and that may be due to the fact that so many apps haven't figured out the best way to optimize the app for each individual phone due to the fragmentation problems or something else.  Either way, I feel like the iOS environment and hardware is more reliable in my everyday use.

3. Fingerprint sensor.  Once you've used it, you won't go back.  The S5 is not that close yet in terms of usability with their sensor.  The one in the iPhone 6 works really well.  I definitely have found myself using my phone more because of how easy it is to unlock and install apps.

4. Control of apps.  This is an interesting point.  In general, you get way more control over how to use and how to integrate your apps on Android than iOS.  But in iOS, it's really interesting that you can control the kind of notification that gets sent to your phone, background refresh, location requirement, and access to certain things like photos and camera.  In Android, you can do all of this as well, but sometimes for a lot of apps you have to have root access.

5.  Double tap to bring down the row of apps.  I can't believe no one has thought of this before.  A lot of Android phones have gigantic screens, but no one has really figured out how to best get the users to interact with that.  You can tap the home button twice on the iPhone to bring down the top few rows of the apps so that you can access them in one hand use.

Here are the things that I miss on Android:
1. Full integration of almost any apps and control of default apps.  I can set default apps on Android whereas Apple does not allow that.  I can open up photos and upload them to Dropbox or any other app that I choose to, whereas Apple doesn't allow uploading to Dropbox via the Photos app (you have to open up Dropbox, then select upload and then go to Photos from there).

2. Better email.  In the mail app for Android, you can attach almost any file on the phone.  You can't do that on Apple.  You can't even attach a single file.  You have to share a file as an email.  So, forget about replying an email with an attachment.  This is pretty annoying.

3. Productivity is better on Android.  If you are a big dropbox user, you probably know and love Dropsync on Android (seriously, best 5 bucks spent on any app).  You can have an app that syncs and download any material from Dropbox onto your Android and then sync it back up when changes are detected.  It's so seamless.  Apple does NOT allow that (mainly because they don't allow background apps from accessing the hard drive, or something along those lines).  So you have to download the file you are interested in manually from the Dropbox app.  It just slows you down a lot, especially if you get to a part of a building where there is weak signal for wifi or cellular data.

4. Notifications are way better.  Why can't Apple make one button that clears all of your notifications?  You have to individually close each app's own notification.  I pretty much leave my notification screen untouched.

5.  Some other things that many already know: Google Now is way better/useful than Siri.  Material design looks awesome! Way better widgets and the fact that you can have widgets!! Oh, and you can swipe right on the home screen on Android and that brings another screen from the left side... can't do that on iOS, the home page is set to be the left most one.  More customization and etc.

Conclusion:
Overall, I think the iPhone is a fine device to use and you probably won't regret investing in one.  The customer service from Apple is top notch, even if their parts cost an arm and leg.  I think that, and I hate to say this because it's going to sound like every blog writer out there, the choice really does come down to personal preference and what you use the phone for.  So, I've broken down my recommendation based on user case scenarios:

If you are user type...

Workaholic, Students: Android will be the best option unless your company/job dictates that you use an iPhone.  The integration with all the apps and the feature with dropbox is just so important to anyone who works on their phones and other mobile devices.  I would either get a pure Google device (N5 or N6, I like smaller phones... so N5 is up there) or a Google Edition device, or the Moto X.  Samsung and HTC are also good choices but updates may be slow.  One Plus One is actually pretty cool.  They are not the best when it comes to customer service since they're a small company filling huge demand, but from my experience, the device is solid and definitely a work horse.

Medical and Science community: iPhone.  Unfortunately, most of the med and science people rely on Apple products, and a lot of new apps still come to iOS first or are better updated and designed on iOS.

Recreational, use a phone as a communication device and for fun:  iPhone.  The camera and social apps are fun to use on the iPhone.

For older folks: This is a split.  If you've used Apple products before, then iOS will be easy to learn.  Android phones have gotten a LOT easier to use thanks to a big push from Google dealing with not only the UI from a software perspective but also from a design perspective.  It is more intuitive than it used to be.

Photographer, blogger, foodie: iPhone 6 still has the best selection of apps and arguably the best camera.  Samsung's camera is great, but the company is known to really bog down their stellar devices with bloatware that ruins or significantly slows down your phone after 1 year of use.  I love the HTC ONE in design, but their gamble on the cameras have not paid off for their customers or themselves.

So was this the right switch for me?  As I'm learning more about the iPhone and iOS, I've realized that when the two year is over or whenever this phone dies on me, I'll most likely switch back to Android.  While I think I've been thoroughly spoiled by the fingerprint sensor, the productivity that I enjoyed on Android just doesn't replicate itself here on the iPhone.  Maybe it's not meant to be a super productive machine, but I guess my main point is that I'd like to have that option available when I need it.

Another side note:  Most of the shortfalls of either Android and iOS can be bypassed via means of rooting, custom ROMs, and jailbreaking (in the case of iOS).  And I do understand that a lot of people enjoy doing this and can get their phones to work fantastically well.  I used to do a lot of customization and go through ROMs once every three days on my Android devices, but I've come to realize that I'd rather spend that time using the device than customizing it.  So, nowadays, I just want my devices to work right out of the box.  The little details like a great camera, fingerprint sensor, and the ability to have my dropbox synced on the go and a good notification system should all be there when I turn on my phone.

Summary and TL; DR:
So there you have it.  An Android user's thoughts on using the iPhone 6.  Do I have regrets switching over?  After using my friend's One Plus One and seeing Material Design on my old N4, I definitely regret it.  But for now, the iPhone 6 suits my needs, even if there are occasional frustration points.  If you are an Android user, please consider all these points and google similar stories before switching.

Also, I'm one of those workaholics and forever in search of super productivity, hence my review that I'd like to go back to Android.  However, I know plenty of people who swear by their iPhones for productivity.  If you are always connected and depend on a suite of iOS specific apps (including apps that are better designed or work better on iOS), then chances are you love the iPhone.  There are plenty of things to like and love about either OS.  It really does come down to personal preference.

***UPDATE 2/9/15: I got to try the new Outlook 2015 app by Microsoft, and it has alleviated a lot of the email/attachment issues that I have mentioned above.  It allows you to sign into your Exchange, Outlook accounts as well as your Gmail, Yahoo, and iCloud emails.  You can also integrate your OneDrive, GoogleDrive, Dropbox and Box accounts, and that's where the magic begins.  Once integrated, you can attach any file located in those drives, which is great!  You can also attach files that are attached in emails that are already in your inbox!  And, you can now reply an email with the option of attaching a file.  Finally, you can decide if you want to open up links from emails in Safari or another browser installed on your phone (so, you are no longer bound by default Apple apps).  This is a huge step forward, and it's from Microsoft (a pleasant surprise).  ***This app has really improved my productivity needs, since when considering the iPhone we have to take into account the hardware and the software/app ecosystem, i think this makes sense to bump up the rating to 4/5.

It doesn't work any better than the 5s  even though it has many more gigs! It still locks up and I clear it all the time to get it to work! Also I DL a song from ITunes which is paid for but STILL not in my song list! I called apple and got 4 hours of conversation and at the end you might think a small problem like that that would be solved??? No, I was told someone would call me back....I'm still waiting its been 2 weeks!!!! The camera is ok on this phone. Though it's very grainy. DO NOT WAISTE YOUR HARD EARNED $ ON THIS PHONE! I PAID FULL PRICE THINKING IT WAS REALLY GREAT! Don't be fooled by the hype. Most of my friends have switched from Iphone to Android and love them. I have not done this yet so I can't really from experience there. It's AMAZING to me this phone is worth a 5 star rating? Really? People are easily duped and go for ANYTHING that is on TV.

I've used Android and Windows phones as well. The pros are good build quality, nice display, good sound and call quality, decent battery life. But, IMO, you can get all this with an Android device at a fraction of the cost. Die hard Apple fans will be happy regardless. Windows phones are by far the best bang for the buck, but apps are still limited.  Several big annoyances for me with the Apple phone. You're stuck having to install and use iTunes to manage the phone such as to add music or ringtones. Even with the majority of 3rd party programs, iTunes still needs to be installed for them to work. If there is any bug or problem with iTunes, then you can have problems. I could not get music on my PC to sync with the phone whether using iTunes or a 3rd party program. The transfer would just fail without any warning. After more than 20 minutes on phone with Apple tech, who couldn't figure the problem out, I was disconnected and never got a call back. Ended up trouble shooting the problem myself and discovered the trouble was from the iTunes installation being on a ""locked drive"". Google ""repair security permissions for itunes for windows"" for the solution.  If you don't have unlimited data, and want to turn cellular data off, you may find your bluetooth voice commands won't work.  You'll need to turn Siri off for them to work, otherwise, you'll have to listen to Siri telling you to connect to the internet.  If you're a fan of Apple and don't care about price, or there is a business need to use Apple, buy this phone. If you want value for your money, have the freedom of choice, and to optimize for your personal use, then you have many more and better options elsewhere. A final word, imo, if you want the best price on an unlocked gsm iphone 6, buy it direct from Apple.  I can verify that the no contract T-mobile iphone 6 they sell will work just fine with an AT&T sim card.","3.0 out of 5 stars"

I dropped all my other iphones from higher levels onto hard floors and they would never shatter, but the 6 did. I feel as though apple should be making their phones built to last. If I have to pay that much money for a phone I would expect it to at least have some kind of resilience to breaking when it’s dropped. I know they offer a warranty, but that is even more money tacked onto the $700 I am already paying. To me something selling for such a high price should be more impressive and durable.","3.0 out of 5 stars"

Specs, specs and more specs! Plus what’s new and why we should even think about upgrading from our iPhone 5s.

1: Size: The dimensions and weight of course matter; unless you don’t mind carrying around a brick the size of trailer. The iPhone 6 comes in at 5.44 x 2.64 x 0.27 inches & weighing in at 4.55 oz. which of course is a bit larger than my 5s. This should help out some of us with slightly larger hands, but still have a nice grip and feel for all around daily use, ease of navigation and just general accessibility.

2: RETINA HD DISPLAY: Having shatter proof glass is definitely necessary, unless you plan on keeping your iPhone 6 in the retail box- never holding it and making phone calls on speaker phone for the rest of your life. Yes, it’s upgraded from my old 5s Retina display to the RETINA HD DISPLAY! So why is it better you ask?

Cons: Breaks extremely easy.

The bottom line: Great phone for basic use. The phone breaks extremely easy, I have had my screen replaced 4 times and the actual phone once within the last 13 months.

I am an avid Apple user. I enjoy most products that apple puts out. The iPhone 6 is not there best phone when it comes to durability but is a great phone for your basic smartphone use. I use my phone constantly for e-mails, school, work, games, social media ect.

Apps: The Apple App Store is always amazing. The new games that come out each day are always very impressive. The apps are quick, and are appealing to the eyes which makes you craving to come back for more. I use Facebook, Twitter and Spotify the most. They are all easy to navigate and if your switching from an android to an apple product they are basically the same.

Battery Life: The battery life is mediocre. I have to charge it once to twice a depending on if I am using it a lot. The phone has a great new feature called battery save mode, that turns off a bunch of background features that chews up battery life in when our not using your phone. I would also recommend keeping the brightness down as much as possible. This can use a lot of battery and you will find that it dies quickly.

Finger print scanner: Is a great feature! I use it every time when unlocking my phone. It can be a bit slow if you have a case over it but that is expected. The new iPhone 6s is updated and works a lot faster than the six but nothing that would greatly affect your decision to upgrade.

Sound: The sound on the iPhone is not that great, its just like all other iPhones that can be loud but is easy to blow your speakers if you blast music 24/7.

Durability: The durability of the phone is awful. Don't use the phone without a very good case. I dropped this phone off my couch with an otter box on it and it still shattered the screen. I even shattered my phone with a LifeProof case on it. I would recommend getting tempered glass and having a case on it. The phone is very slippery making it easy to drop. So if you like me and always on the go I would recommend getting the iPhone 5 because it is thicker and easier to not drop.

Price: The price is not too bad for a iPhone especially if its unlocked. You are getting what you paid for. I wouldn't recommend getting an unlocked one. If your contracts up you can lease the phone through most carriers.","3.0 out of 5 stars"

Apple has gotten to a point where they've drawn in all their customers and Apple knows they can't escape. Because of this, customers will pay basically anything short of their first born to buy this phone. The price can't even be explained by its features. As an example, Galaxy S5 has just about the same amount of features plus more (waterproof, auto-encryption, multiple users using Android L.)

Also, the durability is also garbage. How often do you see an iPhone with a cracked screen? Almost every day! Galaxy products, to use the same example as before, are a lot more tough and durable. I've dropped my phone multiple times, yes I'm careless, and it doesn't have a scratch on it. This way, I don't have to waste MORE money on buying a case just to protect the said ""smart glass.""

Overall, it's a high price for a cheap phone.","2.0 out of 5 stars"

I currently happily own a 15"" top of the line Retina Macbook Pro and previously owned the original iPhone, 3gs, and iPhone 4 before switching to Android with the Nexus 4.

While the Nexus 4 served me quite well and could have much longer, I decided to look into & test all of the latest new phones on the market, including the iPhone 6, before deciding to buy the Samsung Galaxy Note 4 which so far I think is really awesome!

I think the Note 4 is the best phone I've ever owned and I don't miss the closed enviroment of the iPhone, requiring frequent jailbreaks if you want to break out of the jailed environment, but even worse in my opinion is the iPhone 6 comes with just 1GB of RAM!

Even my 2 year old Nexus 4 had 2GB of RAM and my new Samsung Galaxy Note 4 comes with a whopping 3GB of RAM, with expandable storage of up to an extra 128GB via a micro-sd card, making it easy to store more files and play that data with ease!

While the iPhone 6 will serve those who want a pretty phone or the technology challenged well (who still may use a VCR that flashes 12:00 all the time), but for anyone who wants a powerful phone that's not 2 years behind you should buy a better phone!","1.0 out of 5 stars"

Good seller this`s my 2nd iPhone Unlocked through this guys. This is iPhone 6 Model A1549, works with DIGITEL in Venezuela also LTE is properly working. I also try a Telefonica SIM in Mexico, and AT&T Sim in the US with no issues at all. Truly an unlocked one. Box come in original sealed package.

Why I choose 3 stars? Well, I`ve been an iPhone user since 1st gen iPhone, iPhone3, iPhone4, iPhone 4S, iPhone 5, iPhone 5S and meanwhile this iPhone 6... I`ll always felt better with every new iPhone until this one. I believe iPhone 5S is equal or a little faster than this iPhone 6, also the user experience with phone proportions is better in iPhone 5S. Is really annoying need to use the ""smart small screen"" function (press home button in a tricky way) because the screen is so big that you need to use both hands for some functions. Yes the bigger screen is great when you have the time to browse the web, read your emails and so on, also to people with vision issues (the bigger letters are simple better), BUT for me, I use this iPhone mainly LIKE A PHONE, and it is just better the iPhone 5S size for FULL and faster functionality with only one hand.

Also, I`m really MAD with iOs bugs, for example, if you use the ""Vibrate/Sound"" Button several times a day (I use it A LOT), well the iPhone just won`t sound at all, if you use Music it just muted, no matter how many times you press play/puse, stop, close all apps, turn switch to vibrate-sound  100times... if anoyone sent you a video through whatsapp it won`t sound, surfing the web: no sound, and so on... only fix: TURN OFF/ON your iphone... really??

Another anyoning bug: Assistive touch function, I told you guys before that the screen is too big to use with only one hand, allright, iOs has this pretty cool function that shows a virtual HOME BUTTON into ur screen (I used it a lot in my last iPhone 5S), well you put this litte cool button in the middle left or right of the screen (to have it near of ur finger, right?) well, iOs just troll you and move it into the farest corner just to avoid you little finger to use it and have to use again: BOTH HANDS, ok you got me, where`s the hidden camera guys?...

Another bug? iCloud control panel for windows sucks, iCloud photos stop sync (with PC or mac) when it wants, just simply dont work.

Another one? Sometimes is just slow... with 5-10 apps openend or no one, iOs animation slows the use experience, even if you DISABLE animation in advance options...

I`ve been using this iPhone6 for almost two months, and I`m not totally happy with it, its the more expensive phone I ever own, I wish I had for almost 1.000 bucks: the same coolest screen size, FASTER phone with a BRILLIANT iOS like it was in golden Apple years... this one its not the better I have owned.","3.0 out of 5 stars"

I bought my iPhone through Apple and it is not the unlocked version (it is tied to AT&T), so I am just reviewing the phone itself.

First of all, I have owned every iPhone since the 3G. I currently am using the iPhone 6 Plus, but my wife has the iPhone 6 and I use it extensively also.

I bought the iPhone 6 Plus and 6 on launch day. I did extensive research and comparing different factors to make the decision of which iPhone to buy. Like I mentioned, I personally chose the iPhone 6 Plus and knowing what I know now, I wish I would have bought the iPhone 6.

The iPhone is noticeably larger than the iPhone 5/5s, both wider and taller. It is also significantly and noticeably thinner. As you can read and tell from photos, the design of the body is also completely different with the iPhone 6. Another major difference this year is the read camera actually protrudes from the back of the phone. This is because the phone is so thin, the camera components literally could not fit within the thickness of the phone body. I personally do not mind this because I have a case on my iPhone 6. But, if you do not have a case, then you will notice the phone ""wobble"" when it is on a flat surface. Although the lens is also made of sapphire, you do run the risk of scratching or damaging this camera if you are not careful.

The rest of the features, such as speed, graphics, display, etc., is all incremental from the iPhone 5s and its not THAT noticeable. In fact, I actually have an iPhone 5s as a work phone, and I have compared it to the iPhone 6 by opening the same apps, loading the same webpages, etc., and occasionally the 5s actually beats the iPhone 6.

My wife and I are heavy photo users with the iPhone 6, and one thing that you can tell is better is the picture quality with the iPhone 6. Additionally, the call quality and sound is definitely noticeable both from your end, and the person who you are calling (the first phone call we made on the iPhone 6 was to my mom, and she said ""what are you calling me from? You sound so much clearer than normal.""

If you have a family or just naturally take a lot of photos, I would recommend that you upgrade to the 128gb model. Because the photo quality is better, the file size is larger so it takes up more space. Add in music, movies, and apps, you can run out of space quickly.

Ultimately, the iPhone 6 is the most amazing iPhone yet and you definitely will not be sorry you purchased it. If you are torn between the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus, I honestly would recommend the 6. I am a 280b, 5'11"" man, and I think the iPhone 6 Plus is just too massive for your hand, pockets, etc.","5.0 out of 5 stars"

I have found pluses and minuses with the iPhone, but I have been really disappointed with the basic functionality of the phone -- things that one would expect to be figured out after six iterations of the phone.

First is that my phone, every now and again, shuts down for no apparent reason.  Plenty of battery power, but I pull out the phone and find out that it is off.  How many calls have I missed?  I find myself hauling the thing out every hour or so just to see if it's working.  (Apple's customer service has been useless about this.)

Email is amazingly primitive.  The rest of the world figured out how to attach a file in 1985.  Apple is still working on it.

Its sometimes extremely hard to compare these phones, when it comes to battery life, pixel density, screen size and build quality. I used [...] to help me compare, and I would recommend checking this out if you are serious about buying an iphone or one of the samsung galaxy phones. 

The great thing about buying an unlocked phone is that you never have to worry about your contract again, and can switch carriers whenever you see a better deal elsewhere. Also using the phone in other countries is no issue!

Love all the feature it has with it and the fact that it's size it's huge

Also one advice I will give to you when you buy it
Buy a phone case too if you want it too last longer
You would really enjoy it and the amazing features it has with it
What I love most is the camera quality it is so clear.
I would high recommend this product to someone whose looking to buy a good high tech phone like this one
The only CON
Will be that it can easily slip off your head if you'rent aware and careful

I'll try to make this short and sweet,  this iPhone has an extraordinarily  then case, it bends easily just like the 6+, the camera protrudes from the case, you don't think of this being a problem until you set the phone down and try to play a game or text somebody,  The wobbling of the phone is very annoying, being an electrician I pay a great amount of attention to detail, especially in the charging system, or electrical cords, I love the iPhones lightning cord technology it's outstanding, however these phones cost $800 and up,  and the cord you receive is extremely short, and poorly made, The screen technology falls short in comparison to a lot of the newer technology out there, Samsung, LG,  and others,  they need to understand what true high-definition really means. The battery life in these phones are actually going downhill, as far as this area is concerned, the battery life on the newer generation  iPhones are getting worse not better, that is a fact, the batteries become completely  useless  after 8 to 9 months of use, and then are extraordinarily expensive to replace, if you're able to do so at all, here is the biggest issue, and let me remind you once again these phones start at $800,  when you upgraded your iOS operating system, it always slows down your phone, and eventually making the phone completely obsolete, you can tell the usual signs, the phone crashes and goes back to the homepage, lots of chop when you surf the Internet, and you have to clear your memory and cookies constantly,  I work on iMac computers all day long, however i'm at the point now that I'd rather not use an iOS driven device,  just so you understand these are genuine concerns, they're making the phone look very pretty,  however do they still have the short cord after all these years, why yes they do,  understand this has been there largest consumer complaint, that and the fact that these phones will not hold onto a Wi-Fi signal, this has been a huge problem and still exist today in nearly all of their models,  before making a  purchase, I would highly recommend you background the phone on the Internet,  and find out what's really going on with these devices,  I love Apple products, and I thought Steve Jobs was truly a genius  however, Mr. Cook has  most certainly drop the ball.

Before this switch, I've used the Samsung Galaxy S2 (first smartphone ever!) and also the Nexus 4. Since I'm a tech enthusiast, I'm well versed and have played around with many other Android devices, including all the big names, Galaxy S5, HTC One M8 and M7, One Plus One, and so on. Here are my thoughts:

Things that the iPhone does really well (both hardware and software-wise):
1. Camera. The behind the scene software for digitally capturing an image is definitely the strongest sell for the iPhone. Other than the S5 and Note 4, no smartphone really comes close to having the same kind of image quality (no matter the megapixels) compared to the iPhone. This was one of the reasons for me to switch over since I've started to dabble with photography and wanted a really good camera in my smartp... Read more","4.0 out of 5 stars"

  I have had this phone for a few months now, and I have found what I like, and what I do not like about it. I love the operating system, iOS, that runs on it. It is very clean, smooth, and does not have many glitches. I have had almost no problems navigating around the device. Navigation is made easy with search on the home screen, so I don't have to look through all of my apps just to find the right one. It also had some unique features which I really like, such as the fingerprint scanner. The fingerprint scanner is very consistent, and works very well. I have programmed my most used fingers into the system so I always can unlock the phone no matter how I hold it. Another pro about this device is that it is very light, as compared to other phones of its caliber.
  I do have a few cons about this phone though. First, the battery life is not great. I find that with regular use, the battery life can drain very fast. Usually, I'm having to  recharge this phone at least once a day. I'd recommend buying a good battery pack if you were to get this phone. My other issue is that the camera is not high quality, as compared to other phones at a similar price point. This camera is only 8MP, whereas most phones at this price have 13MP or higher.
  Overall, the design and function of this phone is great. It is quick, powerful, and can handle everyday use. As long as you carry a portable charger, you should rarely run out of battery.","4.0 out of 5 stars"

The slimness is a huge improvement. The camera is not as greatly improved as I had hoped, and my friend's photos on other cell phone brands seem to have more pixels. I finally got smart and got the maximum memory. I almost got the gold phone but I changed my mind at the last minute, because I didn't want to stare at a white front, I'm too accustomed to black. I also didn't want to go any bigger than this--you can fit this into a purse or pocket. It also seems lighter than my iPhone 5, though in fact, it is just slightly heavier. It's much easier to handle and use. It looks more elegant, and though I've dropped it a few times, it hasn't scratched or cracked like my iPhone5.

It is very fast and responsive.  The camera is excellent and does not have the delay that the s5 had.  The finger print scanner is excellent and a feature that is surprisingly useful.  You can unlock your iPhone with it or purchase stuff online with just your finger print.  I know the s5 also has one but it is years behind and can only be set up with one finger where the iPhone you can set multiple fingers which makes it nice if you switch hands while using the phone.  Also you have to swipe to unlock the S5 which can take multiple times to do where is the iPhone really takes more than a half second touch and unlock.  The battery life for me was about the same as on the s5 although I did like the power saving mode on the s5 which iPhone does not have.  The charging time on the iPhone seems to be about half the time it took to charge the galaxy S5 though so it's nice to know if you can plug it in for a few minutes you can charge about a percent per minute where the s5 was about 1% every two minutes. Another thing I prefer on the iOS system is Siri which is also years ahead of Google talk.  Much more useful, understands me better, many more functions and just much more refined.  If you're on the fence for a new phone the iPhone six will not disappoint you.","5.0 out of 5 stars"

I've been using it on and off for over a year now and Although it is the newest of technology, words cannot describe how strongly I dislike this phone or more simply put: I HATE IT

One home button for everything, like what the Hell am I supposed to do with that?

Screen shattered rather easily compared to the Galaxies Ive used

External Volume does not sound loud enough to my liking (room has to be completely quiet to be able to hear the phone 100%) , compared to my old GS3 with its external speakers that can pound music that can be heard easily while I'm taking my shower ... I turn my ringer all the way up and still miss calls and late replies to texts because I can't hear it go off (I'm not the type to be on my phone all day unlike most of you brainwashed zombies)

Touch sensor barely works, I had to add 3 of my fingerprints just to make it work better and still doesn't even unlock my phone half the time

This crappy phone freezes AT LEAST three times a day, feels like it happens more often when I actually need to use it

Battery life is ""meh"": as previously stated I don't use my phone much, I keep the battery percentage meter turned on and everytime I go to check my phone (about once every 4-6hours) it seems to decrease 10% just from normal sleep standby

I don't like how I can't add any additional storage via SD cards

My BIGGEST issue is how they advertise a 16GB phone yet when I check system settings it is only 11.8GB! Bogus! They jip you on 27% of what they say it is and people are still dumb enough to buy this garbage! I know the 4.2GB is taken up by system settings and software but they should build more memory into the phone to accommodate for that. Seriously my 8GB GS3 (+1GB micro SD card) holds WAY more content than this crappy iPhone6 does!

Which is why I mentioned earlier that I use my iPhone6 on and off because I switch back to my GS3 for most uses (which is sad because that phone is a few years older) and use my Iphone6 only when I want to take high-quality pictures and videos

Only thing I like about this phone is how beautiful colors are displayed (up until I shattered the cheap glass screen now I hate looking at the damned thing) & how excellent the camera picture quality is (front facing camera still sucks just like any other phone with a front facing camera but I don't even use it anyway as I just turn my phone around if I want to capture pictures of my beautiful self)

Overall I rate it 1 out of 5 stars, garbage like this is why I do not buy Apple products. They are just too cheaply made yet sell for insane prices because most of you people are too stupid to know that you're getting ripped off! However I do enjoy my 3rd generation iPod Nano (back when Apple made halfway decent products) which has lasted me since middle school (2008) only recently noticing a decrease in battery life (doesn't last as long as it used to)","1.0 out of 5 stars"

A week ago I bought the 64GB version Iphone_6 (not here, I'm from Moscow and I bought the phone on Apple's official website - www.apple.ru) and in the first hour discovered a defect in the auditory dynamics - rustling... it rattles (makes noise like when overloaded). The phone was bought as new (not used, not remanufactured, not refurbished) at the Apple store! Technical support advised me to upgrade the operating system, but it didn't yield results. Using Recovery Mode did not help. Then I changed this phone for another (a new, in the box), but there also have this noise! If I switch to ""speakerphone"", then all is well, no noise.
The serial numbers of both devices are very similar, they are released in September (week 35) 2015 and have the letters ""FF"". Maybe this whole marriage party? By the way, I read somewhere that the symbol ""FF"" stands for ""refurbished""... is it really so?
I don't know what to do. In the support I offer to change this phone to another (the third), but I have no confidence that there will not be the same defect. Authorized service center advised me to give in for repair - they will replace the speaker, but to repair the phone, which I didn't use yet - I don't really want.
Of course, if this defect in all the phones, then I have no choice. Rather, the choice is - take the money and buy a phone from another manufacturer, but I have so many years happy to use Apple products (very used to it!), for me it will be a very tough decision.

I have seen the things that have changed and the things that have stayed the same as Apple has moved from being a sinking dinghy to a thriving cruise line.

I switched from Android to this iPhone, but I have had quite a bit of experience with iPhones as my family has them, I have a model for work, etc. In general Android is far more flexible in allowing the user to create their own experience. It's like a car, you pick the model with the factory and dealer installed options you want and then you can make your own changes. Apple limits the user modifications heavily (specifics below).

I switched from Android because I was tired of all freezes, pauses and crashes and all the iPhone reviews state the opposite. My hope is that I can live without the customization abilities to get a more stable and responsive solution. So far my experience is the iPhone is hands down the better hardware, better hardware/software integrate and has far better performance and stability.

For reference on performance and stability, I have 154 apps installed, am using 75.2GB of the storage, 60.4 for purchased videos, 3.7GB for Photos & Videos taken by the camera, 1.7GB Music, 2.7GB for Apple's productivity apps, 182MB mail (8 mail accounts, 3 are Exchange accounts), have custom mail signatures for all accounts, custom notifications for everything including different notifications for each mail account, use the Do Not Disturb feature option and have it enable automatically in the evening, use the Control Center and Notification Center often, have customized the Notification Center, Wallpaper on the home and lock screens, use WiFi, Bluetooth and VPN often, use iCloud and Passbook/Apple Pay, have many alarms, etc. Point is with all this the iPhone is responsive and stable and with a few exceptions the iPhone version of apps have been better than their Android counterparts.

Batter life seems better, but comparing a Galaxy Note 2 (2 years old) with a current iPhone is not fair. As far as the other comparisons, I know people who have Galaxy S5's, Note 4's and other android phones and the performance and stability problems still exist which is backed by the reviews.

I will say that the camera is not as amazing as indicated. I have had many issues with graininess and very slow focus. It's certainly hard to get a good picture quickly.

I have been told that the iPhone is a more polished product and I would agree, but I would say it's a very polished version 1.5 to 2.5 product. However, some items are clearly further along because Apple has focused on those apps/features.

The most glaring thing lacking customization in the iPhone, the version 1.0 item, is the clock. With everything that Apple does to make our lives easier, they are glued to a 1970s/1980s electronic alarm clock paradigm.

1) You have no control over snooze time and therefore, there is no default setting that the user can change, no per alarm snooze time option and no on the fly snooze time options.

2) An alarm can be set for the next occurrence of the time you set or every x day, but not this Friday just one time or for a specific date. You have to set your alarm the day before or if your future planning fits with the limited options, you can plan your alarms ahead. So I'll create an alarm, turn it off and then set a reminder to remind me to turn it on. That seems more complicated than it should be.

3) Someone will say, just replace the clock, except only the Apple clock works with an option like Do Not Disturb on, so if DND is on you have to leave a 3rd party clock app up on the screen, not in the background, for the alarms to work. I use DND because during sleep time I only want calls, texts and alarms and I can click the silent switch to disable call and text sounds on the fly.

The bottom line is that it is clear that Apple does not care about this app and there is not a good replacement option.

Another glaring issue is iMessage and SMS. Why do I need to care if my contacts iPhone is connected in a way that allows special iMessage messages. If iMessage can't reach an SMS device via iMessage, then it should automatically send the message as SMS. It should not take 10 minutes or hours or days or longer if ever for people to get a text. I can turn those features off, but I lose functionality that does not require iMessage that Apple only provides for iMessage contacts. This is another immature thing. It's like a CD player made by a record label that only plays CDs produced by said label.

This and the lack of being able to seamlessly use Google Voice are the only things that keep Android in my view. For reference, in Android you can set your default app to use for everything including phone, messaging, etc. So if I opened the main phone app, typed in a number or selected from the address book, when I clicked call it would call with my default which could be my Verizon number or my GV number or I could set it to ask me. So yes I can use GV on my iPhone, but not with that level of convenience.

The list below is not exhaustive, but provides a good example of why I consider it version 1.5 to 2.5 software.

1) Already covered alarm clock app, iMessage and SMS and app integration like I described with Google Voice.

2) No status indicator when in silent mode (switch on side of phone). Some have said just look at the switch. Well there are a number of reasons why that is not the best option for everyone. It's hard to see in the dark. If you have a case it's even harder to see. By that logic, get rid of all status icons and you can go to the respective setting to see the status of that item. It's a simple status icon and there should be an option to show it.

3) When selecting from the address book to add contacts to mail, imessage, etc, it would be awesome if you could select multiple. i.e. I may search for work contacts and want to select more than one rather than performing the same search over and over.

4) Limited options when working with Bluetooth and WiFi connections. You can forget a device and with Bluetooth, there may be some options, but you can't simply disconnect from a device or network and with bluetooth you can't limit what the device is used for. i.e. I may have a bluetooth earpiece for making calls, but I may not want music to come through that device.

With the disconnect sometimes it's convenient to disconnect without turning off the feature especially with bluetooth which should support multiple pairings. For WiFi, I had an issue where it would not see other networks. Turning it off and on did not fix the issue. I had to forget the network that it was automatically attaching to and then I could see other networks. Having to forget a device or network should not be the solution. That should only have to be used if you want to forget the item or there is a problem with that specific item.

5) For Do Not Disturb you have one auto option so you can have auto on/off on different days and when turning it on on the fly you have no option to turn it off after a period of time.

6) The Command Center is nice, but it leaves much to be desired. Being able to quickly turn items on and off is nice, but what if you want to choose a specific WiFi network or Bluetooth device.

How about being able to click and hold to select from a list of devices/networks with an option to open the WiFi/Bluetooth main settings?

At the very least, and this should be there even if the more specific options described above are provided, a button to open settings.

How about allowing an option to allow the Command Center to be accessed via the Notification Center (pulled from the top)?

7) Changing settings can be a pain. I do like that there is a single place you can go for some settings such as notifications, Cellular Data Use, privacy, etc and a single place to quickly get to all app settings, but that benefit should not remove the ability to get to all of these settings from within an app. It's the equivalent of adding steering wheel controls for the radio, a/c, etc and removing the corresponding console controls.

8) The mail app is nice, but there are some issues.

When adding a more complex (standard) signature with an image and hyperlinks, the settings app crashes and it looses my images, so a couple of emails have the image and then the image disappears.

Not being able to set per folder ""Mail Days to Sync"" is a bummer. I have folders that I keep all important mail in that I need access to offline. I have other folders that have a lot of mail and I do not want all the messages in those folders to download when I do have to look at them on occasion. There needs to be more flexibility with this option.

The options unread, To or CC, VIP, Flagged, attachments, etc per mailbox would be nice.

This is my review and I hope it helps you!","4.0 out of 5 stars"

Both deisgn and quality of the iPhone have suffered significantly over the years (the quality of the glass is so poor it scratches if you stare at it).  This convinced me not to upgrade the iPad so I installed iOS 8. Another mistake.  My old iPad has never worked so poorly.  As for moving to a Mac, the idea has completely disappeared from my head.

So Ill break it down for you guys. Im not the biggest Apple fan in the world. I do not own anything other than an iPhone. But I have been buying iPhones for 6 plus years (no pun intended). I've been a huge fan of the super user friendly iOS that they have on them. The phones have a lot of limitations. But for a phone, I would never complain. I will say the same thing I tell everyone who asks about iPhones and iPads and what have you, ""The iPhone is a great phone, but if you want a tablet, go android."" The android tablets defeat the iPad in every way I could possible imagine. Yet, I digress.

Now onto the iPhone 6 itself. I purchased the space grey model with the 128gb hard drive. The very first thing I noticed with this phone was the screen. I wont go into the specifics of pixel density. The iPhone 6 does not have the highest. But the particular screen they used is what is called 5k (basically 4k but Apples name for it) and it just looks beautiful. The clarity it boasts puts not only previous iPhones, but other past phones to shame. Like it should right? Its a brand new phone. It should be a lot more innovative than any phone that came before it, right? Well, my answer to that is no, it doesnt. Apple took what we loved of the iPhone and just reused it in this phone. They improved a lot of the phones features, but once again, there is nothing that this phone offers that you could not find in other phones on the market today. But Im still loyal to the iPhone for its incredibly easy to use interface.

Now the next thing that blew my mind with this phone is the camera and video recorder. I go to concerts a lot. And I love getting pictures of the bands while they are in action. I also love getting videos of my favorite songs so I can relieve those moments. Ive recorded a lot of videos with previous phones and the audio/video quality is just terrible. Until I got this phone. The camera has a new software added to it to allow it to keep focused much better than the previous phones. The same software is used in one of the newer Samsung phones as well, so once again, nothing new to the table. So when me and my friend are at a Blue Oyster Cult concert, we decided to see who's phone recorded better audio/video. He was using the Samsung Galaxy 5. His video was the same if not slightly better than mine. He could also zoom in much closer than I was able too. However, the audio on my videos kicked his phones butt up and down that stage. Anytime the drums would, be it bass pedal or cymbal, his phones audio would just clip. Meanwhile, my iPhone takes those louder noises in stride and produced the best video I've ever managed to record on a phone. Also, just to add a bit more, there was a short film shot entirely with an iPhone 6. Its a FPS romance film about two lovers living their day to day life in New York I do believe. I watched the trailer they had on Youtube for it a while back and the quality was really good. So kudos iPhone for filming a movie!

They added some new apps to the iPhone when this phone came out. Though I do believe you can get those apps on the previous incarnations of the iPhone. The biggest thing Apple has been bragging about however is Apple Pay. Unlucky for me, I live in a smaller city that hasnt quite adapted to these ""new fangled ways"" of getting into dept, I mean shopping. So I havent gotten to try Apple Pay. Maybe one day soon though.

So all in all guys, I love my iPhone 6. This phone however does not offer something that you couldnt find in another phone, except maybe the stupid high amount of memory you can get now. And for someone like me who loves having an easy to use interface and a bunch of memory (my phone is my iPod. Its just more convenient) then this phone would be a damn good choice. Apple could have put more features and made the phone much more unique, but I was happy with the changes they've made since the iPhone 5 and I just hope the iPhone 7 will give us features on our phones we never knew possible. Happy shopping fellows.","5.0 out of 5 stars"

Everyone who is reading this review has probably owned an iPhone 5 and some own even older models. There are a few improvements since say the iPhone 5 so I wanted to help the audience that has the iPhone 5 (not saying I exclude others)

Here are the major improvements since the iPhone 5,

a) CAMERA - My word, there is more detail, almost takes a photo in the worst ever lit room, very sharp, excellent photos, the macro could be a little better but you can download several applications to counter the macro recognition system. Older iPhone 5 now looks grainy.

b) CALL QUALITY - Much louder on speaker, better earphone speaker than before. The iPhone 5 was very good but when I hold it right next to the iPhone 6, the difference is substantial.

c) SPEAKER - Much louder, clearer, still wouldn't replace my JBL bluetooth but still good enough. Much clearer whether on phone call or while playing music. You almost never ever keep it on 100% volume cause its rudely loud otherwise. I have compared this with my wife's HTC one m8 and it is almost as loud as the boom speaker but we all know HTC has the best speaker.

d) BUILD QUALITY - For the first month, I kind of regretted getting the 6 because it is so much bigger and the one handed operation was useless. I almost never use reachability. The 6 is much more slippery than the iPhone 5 and using without a case is not even an option. So I would say despite the changes, being lighter, i miss the 5's ease of use and build

e) TOUCH ID - DOn't think it makes a difference? You are wrong. It is convenient if not flawless in execution.

f) Display - The brightness and pixel density has improved which ideally means you will find watching videos much better. Owing to a better graphics procesor the iPhone 6 is better for reading, viewing videos.

g) iOS 8 is definitely optimised for iPhone 6. I'm sorry but the Iphone 5 was running the iOS 8 really slow. I really hated it. I was almost strong armed into purchasing the iPhone 6 but overall I can't say I am not satisfied.

Thank God for the 128GB. I no longer have to worry about keeping Pearl Jam's discography on my iPhone.

h) OTHERS - It can charge faster if you use the iPad Air adapter, the battery life is much much better and lasts me about 18 hours which is satisfactory, I read this more often for reading because iBooks is so much fun on this, Apple Pay doesnt work where I live (we avoid using card and love CASH despite it being slimy)","4.0 out of 5 stars"

Before this switch, I've used the Samsung Galaxy S2 (first smartphone ever!) and also the Nexus 4. Since I'm a tech enthusiast, I'm well versed and have played around with many other Android devices, including all the big names, Galaxy S5, HTC One M8 and M7, One Plus One, and so on. Here are my thoughts:

Things that the iPhone does really well (both hardware and software-wise):
1. Camera. The behind the scene software for digitally capturing an image is definitely the strongest sell for the iPhone. Other than the S5 and Note 4, no smartphone really comes close to having the same kind of image quality (no matter the megapixels) compared to the iPhone. This was one of the reasons for me to switch over since I've started to dabble with photography and wanted a really good camera in my smartphone. (Side note, if you read a lot of tech blogs, there is a notion that in the near future our smartphones won't accurately describe our devices anymore since making a phone call is probably one of the least commonly used features on a smartphone when you look at any average user. Cameras, social media, emails all take a higher usage rate than making a call... really interesting, but anyway, back to the review).

2. Reliability. There have been maybe 2 or 3 times when my phone crashed and would have to be restarted, mostly due to playing some game that was not written very well for the iOS devices. On Android devices, I've experienced a lot more crashes, and that may be due to the fact that so many apps haven't figured out the best way to optimize the app for each individual phone due to the fragmentation problems or something else. Either way, I feel like the iOS environment and hardware is more reliable in my everyday use.

3. Fingerprint sensor. Once you've used it, you won't go back. The S5 is not that close yet in terms of usability with their sensor. The one in the iPhone 6 works really well. I definitely have found myself using my phone more because of how easy it is to unlock and install apps.

4. Control of apps. This is an interesting point. In general, you get way more control over how to use and how to integrate your apps on Android than iOS. But in iOS, it's really interesting that you can control the kind of notification that gets sent to your phone, background refresh, location requirement, and access to certain things like photos and camera. In Android, you can do all of this as well, but sometimes for a lot of apps you have to have root access.

5. Double tap to bring down the row of apps. I can't believe no one has thought of this before. A lot of Android phones have gigantic screens, but no one has really figured out how to best get the users to interact with that. You can tap the home button twice on the iPhone to bring down the top few rows of the apps so that you can access them in one hand use.

Here are the things that I miss on Android:
1. Full integration of almost any apps and control of default apps. I can set default apps on Android whereas Apple does not allow that. I can open up photos and upload them to Dropbox or any other app that I choose to, whereas Apple doesn't allow uploading to Dropbox via the Photos app (you have to open up Dropbox, then select upload and then go to Photos from there).

2. Better email. In the mail app for Android, you can attach almost any file on the phone. You can't do that on Apple. You can't even attach a single file. You have to share a file as an email. So, forget about replying an email with an attachment. This is pretty annoying.

3. Productivity is better on Android. If you are a big dropbox user, you probably know and love Dropsync on Android (seriously, best 5 bucks spent on any app). You can have an app that syncs and download any material from Dropbox onto your Android and then sync it back up when changes are detected. It's so seamless. Apple does NOT allow that (mainly because they don't allow background apps from accessing the hard drive, or something along those lines). So you have to download the file you are interested in manually from the Dropbox app. It just slows you down a lot, especially if you get to a part of a building where there is weak signal for wifi or cellular data.

4. Notifications are way better. Why can't Apple make one button that clears all of your notifications? You have to individually close each app's own notification. I pretty much leave my notification screen untouched.

5. Some other things that many already know: Google Now is way better/useful than Siri. Material design looks awesome! Way better widgets and the fact that you can have widgets!! Oh, and you can swipe right on the home screen on Android and that brings another screen from the left side... can't do that on iOS, the home page is set to be the left most one. More customization and etc.

Conclusion:
Overall, I think the iPhone is a fine device to use and you probably won't regret investing in one. The customer service from Apple is top notch, even if their parts cost an arm and leg. I think that, and I hate to say this because it's going to sound like every blog writer out there, the choice really does come down to personal preference and what you use the phone for. So, I've broken down my recommendation based on user case scenarios:

If you are user type...

Workaholic, Students: Android will be the best option unless your company/job dictates that you use an iPhone. The integration with all the apps and the feature with dropbox is just so important to anyone who works on their phones and other mobile devices. I would either get a pure Google device (N5 or N6, I like smaller phones... so N5 is up there) or a Google Edition device, or the Moto X. Samsung and HTC are also good choices but updates may be slow. One Plus One is actually pretty cool. They are not the best when it comes to customer service since they're a small company filling huge demand, but from my experience, the device is solid and definitely a work horse.

Medical and Science community: iPhone. Unfortunately, most of the med and science people rely on Apple products, and a lot of new apps still come to iOS first or are better updated and designed on iOS.

Recreational, use a phone as a communication device and for fun: iPhone. The camera and social apps are fun to use on the iPhone.

For older folks: This is a split. If you've used Apple products before, then iOS will be easy to learn. Android phones have gotten a LOT easier to use thanks to a big push from Google dealing with not only the UI from a software perspective but also from a design perspective. It is more intuitive than it used to be.

Photographer, blogger, foodie: iPhone 6 still has the best selection of apps and arguably the best camera. Samsung's camera is great, but the company is known to really bog down their stellar devices with bloatware that ruins or significantly slows down your phone after 1 year of use. I love the HTC ONE in design, but their gamble on the cameras have not paid off for their customers or themselves.

So was this the right switch for me? As I'm learning more about the iPhone and iOS, I've realized that when the two year is over or whenever this phone dies on me, I'll most likely switch back to Android. While I think I've been thoroughly spoiled by the fingerprint sensor, the productivity that I enjoyed on Android just doesn't replicate itself here on the iPhone. Maybe it's not meant to be a super productive machine, but I guess my main point is that I'd like to have that option available when I need it.

Another side note: Most of the shortfalls of either Android and iOS can be bypassed via means of rooting, custom ROMs, and jailbreaking (in the case of iOS). And I do understand that a lot of people enjoy doing this and can get their phones to work fantastically well. I used to do a lot of customization and go through ROMs once every three days on my Android devices, but I've come to realize that I'd rather spend that time using the device than customizing it. So, nowadays, I just want my devices to work right out of the box. The little details like a great camera, fingerprint sensor, and the ability to have my dropbox synced on the go and a good notification system should all be there when I turn on my phone.

Summary and TL; DR:
So there you have it. An Android user's thoughts on using the iPhone 6. Do I have regrets switching over? After using my friend's One Plus One and seeing Material Design on my old N4, I definitely regret it. But for now, the iPhone 6 suits my needs, even if there are occasional frustration points. If you are an Android user, please consider all these points and google similar stories before switching.

Also, I'm one of those workaholics and forever in search of super productivity, hence my review that I'd like to go back to Android. However, I know plenty of people who swear by their iPhones for productivity. If you are always connected and depend on a suite of iOS specific apps (including apps that are better designed or work better on iOS), then chances are you love the iPhone. There are plenty of things to like and love about either OS. It really does come down to personal preference.

***UPDATE 2/9/15: I got to try the new Outlook 2015 app by Microsoft, and it has alleviated a lot of the email/attachment issues that I have mentioned above. It allows you to sign into your Exchange, Outlook accounts as well as your Gmail, Yahoo, and iCloud emails. You can also integrate your OneDrive, GoogleDrive, Dropbox and Box accounts, and that's where the magic begins. Once integrated, you can attach any file located in those drives, which is great! You can also attach files that are attached in emails that are already in your inbox! And, you can now reply an email with the option of attaching a file. Finally, you can decide if you want to open up links from emails in Safari or another browser installed on your phone (so, you are no longer bound by default Apple apps). This is a huge step forward, and it's from Microsoft (a pleasant surprise). ***This app has really improved my productivity needs, since when considering the iPhone we have to take into account the hardware and the software/app ecosystem, i think this makes sense to bump up the rating to 4/5. There are still kinks when switching over if you are used to productive flexibility on Android phones, but right now the 3rd party apps are getting better and better at work-arounds.","5.0 out of 5 stars"

I have seen the things that have changed and the things that have stayed the same as Apple has moved from being a sinking dinghy to a thriving cruise line.

I switched from Android to this iPhone, but I have had quite a bit of experience with iPhones as my family has them, I have a model for work, etc. In general Android is far more flexible in allowing the user to create their own experience. It's like a car, you pick the model with the factory and dealer installed options you want and then you can make your own changes. Apple limits the user modifications heavily (specifics below).

I switched from Android because I was tired of all freezes, pauses and crashes and all the iPhone reviews state the opposite. My hope is that I can live without the customization abilities to get a more stable and responsive solution. So far my experience is the iPhone is hand... Read more","4.0 out of 5 stars"

I have used previous iPhone's but this is definitely the best of them yet! Came brand new sealed in the box, setup was painless. iOS 8.3 has a very user friendly interface, and it is a fast OS for a mobile device at that. The carrier I chose is Straight Talk. I put my SIM card in, called the number on my SIM activation kit, and was ready to go within 5 minutes! No additional effort was required on my part. Having iCloud made restoring all of my settings a breeze, and, if my phone ever breaks, I won't lose any data since iCloud makes a backup every time the phone is plugged in and connected to wifi! The battery on this is amazing! When it arrived, it was at 80%. I drained it down to 2% and plugged it in until 100% for the first charge. I have not charged it since, besides listening to music through USB in my car when driving, and it's been almost a week.

The build of this phone is beautiful. I bought a waterproof case to keep it that way. I strongly recommend this phone if you like a user friendly, fast, reliable device that won't have a dead battery in a year like most other phones do.","5.0 out of 5 stars"

And sometimes my iPhone 6 speaker will not project sound. Even when I plug it into a new USB cord and into my car to play music, no sound will play. But then, the next day, I plug my phone into the same USB cord and back into my car and it will play music or any other sound. Which I find a littler weird.

I purchased one and returned it after the home button would overheat and the battery drained completely in 3 hours with nearly no usage. So, 2 of 3 iPhone 6 we purchased were defective. I think they are trying to push out as many phones as possible and they're sacrificing inspection and quality control measures. Otherwise, for the average person who waste their money on these expensive phones and never full uses it to it's full potential, this is just like any other iPhone with a bigger screen.

This is expensive, but totally worth it. I think the speed even faster than my Ipad Retina...

The speed of opening browser is so fast, multi-funtional works pretty well too.

Especially the camara, it can adjust the brightness before you press the button, it alleviate the time to edit photos afterwards..which is nice.

The shutter speed is nice as well !

Only complaint I have is that I had it charged 100% midday yesterday and the same time today it's running really low.  With all of the technology out there today, is it really that difficult to make a battery that lasts longer than a single day?  This review is not to be a comparison to other devices; i.e., I'm not saying I have any other device in mind that has a better battery life, but with regard to this product in isolation, you have to consciously think about having your charger on you if you'll be spending the night somewhere.  Always hoping to rely on someone else's cord isn't practical.

But yeah, you won't be unhappy with this phone otherwise.  Great device.","4.0 out of 5 stars"

I had been eligible for a cellphone upgrade for over a year and was reluctant to go with a smartphone because I didn't want my monthly bill to jump.  In January I was at Best Buy browsing at the cellphones to see what was out there.  I was shocked to see that what I had been paying for that little talk/text phone through Sprint that I could have had unlimited talk/text/data for the same price.  Sprint has changed their individual plans to be more affordable.  Just about everyone in my family has an iPhone so I thought, ""what the heck"" I'll try the new iPhone 6.

I used to have a Samsung S4 before this. I tried the iPhone 6, but found it too small. Personally I wished that apple made an iphone thats around 5"" or 5.2"". Im not much of a phablet person, but I decided to try the 6 plus since I wanted an iphone which was larger than the 6. It took me a good 2 weeks to get used to using it. Its a great smartphone with amazing battery life. I can easily get 2-3 days usage out of it. I really like the camera. Its fast, the low light performance is great and its easy to use. The screen gets very bright for outdoor use in the sun. The speaker is very loud, good for music and calls. I do wish there was a stereo speaker. I also wish the 6 plus was smaller in dimensions. Apple has wasted  alot of space especially on the top bezel. The bottom bezel is understanable because of the touch id. Im sure apple will find a way to trim down the 6 plus when the iphone 7 comes out. Performance wise the 6 plus seems great you wouldnt be able to tell it only has 1gb of ram. Lte, 3g and wifi is fast. Call quality is great. Overall I like it but wish the dimensions were smaller and it had stereo speakers.","4.0 out of 5 stars"

However Apple's ITUNES software is HORRID!!!  It's the built in music/video/podcast software for apple products, so it's a huge part of the package.  If you plan on EASILY moving media from your PC to your phone, you're in for a treat! -_-

The interface on iTunes is horrible, it doesn't match their phone style at all.  The iPhone itself is very simple to navigate, everything is pretty much right in front of you.  Where as iTunes is a complete mess.  Whatever happened to having a menu bar on the left that shows your media types and connected devices?  Why do they insist on hiding these things?  It goes against everything we know about what PC media players shold be.  Organization is key, and this is an unorganized dump.

And the words ""drag and drop""....has Apple forgotten these words?  Whatever happened to that?  Oh you can do it, but until a going back and forth all over this horrible software looking to get the settings right.  For example, i want to add 8 songs from an album that has 12 songs.  I hold Ctrl to seclect those songs individually....oh wait that doesnt work anymore either?  OK i guess i have to add them 1 by 1.  So i click the first song and attempt to drag it to....Oh it wont let me drag it.  It says it's not compatible software.  So MP3's are no longer the standard music file type?  I know all these things work, but you first must screw with the settings and i've noticed the settings like ""undo"" themselves.

Just extremely annoying.  Keep it simple and easy.  Already switched my iphone 6 back with my carrier for an android.  Done with Apple's bad software.","2.0 out of 5 stars"

They said no, but led me to believe I would have to take the phone in to be activated. I don't know why they said that.
I'm giving 2 stars because the power adapter plug in the box is European type, and I don't see anywhere in the description that it is a non USA power adapter.

You can unlock your iPhone with it or purchase stuff online with just your finger print.

Also you have to swipe to unlock the S5 which can take multiple times to do where is the iPhone really takes more than a half second touch and unlock.

It loads data quickly and everything works how it should. The screen size was the main reason why I wanted to upgrade - the other iPhone screens always seemed too small. (I didn't go for the 6 PLUS because I wanted the phone to comfortably fit in all my pockets, which this does.) I'm not someone who needs the highest HD resolution screen, so if that's an issue for you then I recommend checking out the iPhone 6 in a store so you can make sure the screen meets your needs.

Otherwise, everything about this phone is awesome. I use Siri a lot to get directions and find the maps feature extremely helpful. If I take a wrong turn, it recalculates directions quickly. This is an impressive feature. The thumb print Touch ID is beyond helpful. I wasn't sure about using it at first, but now I can't imagine punching in the code each time - what a hassle that was! Also, I watch a lot of videos on my phone using my home wifi (no data use that way) and this phone streams video perfectly. It never even gets stuck when the video goes to commercials. this was sometimes a problem with other products.

I'd like to add one little tip: Lower your brightness setting (just ask Siri to do it if you're lazy!). This will extend your battery life, and it's a little easier on the eyes, although I should add that the battery is very good. Have fun and enjoy your phone!","5.0 out of 5 stars"

I need to figure out how to turn off certain Apps.  It's a worthwhile upgrade, especially from a 5 or 4s. If you have a 5s you can still hold off for a while.","4.0 out of 5 stars"

Especially when considering its camera.  Impressively, it was used to shoot an entire full feature film which was premiered at the Sundance Film festival. For those of you who are avid photographers, this phone might be what you’re looking for.
As a photographer, you need advanced photography software on your phone’s camera. You need the ability to take different types of photos in different lighting environments.  You need a phone that will let you take the photos that you want to take. This is what the camera on the iPhone 6 can do for you. The behind the scenes photography software on the iPhone 6 lets you do a lot of cool, unique things with your photography.

iPhone 6 photography software features that you will love:

1. High Dynamic Range: High Dynamic Range (HDR) amalgamates three different exposures of the same image to compose one better exposed photo. This produces a superior range of luminosity than is achievable through standard digital imaging. Your eye can see a much higher dynamic range than any camera. HDR mimics the function of your eye to produce an image that represents how you saw it in person.

2. Geotagging: Have you ever been looking through your photos and forgotten where a favorite one was shot? You can now avoid this frustration. Geotagging is a feature that saves the location of every photo you take. This is a great feature to have when you are travelling. The data collected by Geotagging can be used to display photos from you adventures on a map!

3. Burst Mode: Burst mode allows you to take up to ten photos per second. It’s very easy to use. You don’t need to go into camera settings to turn it on. To activate burst mode, simply hold the shutter button a split second longer than normal. Burst mode is useful when trying to capture the perfect moment when there is movement inside the scene.

There are many more software features unique to the iPhone 6 camera. These features have made everyday photography experience better. Hopefully this review of the iPhone 6 camera was enlightening. I wish you good luck in all of your photography endeavors!","5.0 out of 5 stars"

I hand the phone to someone, and guess what phone they use based on their immediate reaction. iPhone users are always shocked by the sheer size of the 6; they all think it must be the 6 Plus. Android users, on the other hand, are unfazed. ""This looks just like my phone,"" they all say.

They’re not wrong. The iPhone 6 is 5.44 inches tall and 2.64 inches wide, which slots it right in between last year’s Moto X (also a 4.7-inch phone) and the new HTC One. It’s almost exactly the same size as Samsung’s Galaxy S5, just a little thinner and a little lighter. And it shares more in common with the world’s many Android phones — and the original, curvy iPhone — than with the sharp, rectangular iPhone 5S.

THE IPHONE 6 IS THE BIG IPHONE FOR EVERYONE

The iPhone 5S was a stark piece of jewelry, a gorgeous object that was slightly cold and unapproachable. The iPhone 6 is far friendlier and far more usable. Mixing form and function this way is hard to do, and Apple gets it largely right.

It’s simply and cleanly designed, with a metal back that curves cleanly around the sides. There are few seams and no ugly clutter. The only real flaw is the antenna design: Apple opted to essentially outline the top and bottom of the phone’s back with small plastic stripes where wireless radios can transmit signal. It just looks bad, like someone drew on my phone with a marker. HTC’s simple, striped design on the One M8 is far better, and even Apple’s glass-strip-on-the-top-and-bottom approach for the 5S looked nicer.

In a weird way, slim and gorgeous as it is, this iPhone begs to have a case on it. (Apple makes some, including a really nice line of leather cases, and the third-party ecosystem is going to get even bigger.) It helps obscure the unsightly plastic strips, it makes the otherwise slick phone a little easier to grip, and it compensates for the awkwardly protruding camera lens on the back, which prevents the phone from sitting flat on a table. I’m worried I’m going to scratch the lens, and I’m annoyed that the phone wobbles. A case solves both problems.

The 6 is big, much bigger than the 5S or the other iPhones that came before it. It’s even bigger than some other 4.7-inch phones; because Apple refuses to change the top and bottom bezels so as not to disturb the big home button, the phone is much taller than it needs to be. But it’s still usable in one hand and comfortable enough that I never feel terribly awkward using it. I have found myself holding it slightly differently, though: I tend to rest it on my fingers rather than grip it in my palm, the better to reach the farthest corners of the screen.","5.0 out of 5 stars"

My current phone is the iPhone 6 (Verizon) and, to be honest, the only reason I stuck with iPhone after a less-than-stellar experience with the iPhone 5 was because of iMessage.  That being said, I must admit that I’ve been pleasantly surprised by this device.

With regards to the overall look and feel, I think it’s as good as any phone on the market today. The screen is as crisp as I’ve seen on a phone, and while I know there are technically better screens out there, unless you’re big into watching movies or taking pictures/video, chances are this won’t bother you.

As far as the actual workings of the device, it’s no different from previous iPhones in that it’s still simple to use and gets the job done, albeit with a few useful upgrades. The processor is, in my opinion, noticeably faster than what I was used to in my iPhone 5. The fingerprint scanner is also a nice feature, though not one I really care for or use too often.  The OS has some nifty features, such as the Control Center, widgets of sorts can be added to the notifications drop-down, and slightly more options for customization, though the last one is still not on par with what Android users enjoy.

In summary, the iPhone 6's most noticeable perks include:

• Natural feel in your hand
• Sleek and modern design
• Large, crisp screen
• Slightly faster processor than the iPhone 5
• Nifty fingerprint scanner
• (Slightly) better OS than the previous iPhone
• (Slightly) better batter life than the previous iPhone

However, there are a few drawbacks as well. The protruding camera on the back seems like an odd design feature, and makes me hesitant to put the device down on any hard surface. The obvious answer for me was to simply put a case on it, which I would have done regardless.
Battery life also appears to have improved, though I’m still disappointed whenever Apple’s newest iPhone doesn’t grant easy access to the battery itself for easy swap-outs.

Overall, I think the iPhone 6 is a very well-engineered device. Its positive features are much more noticeable than its few shortcomings. If you’re looking for a pretty phone that’s ready to use straight out of the box, this one’s for you.","5.0 out of 5 stars"

"","","Received the iPhone, got it set up only to find that there is a dead spot just right of the home button that extended all the way up causing it difficult to use the letters ""U, H, B"" and the apps in line with the dead spot.  I had to end up taking it in and have a new screen put on it ($115.00) an expense that is unnecessary given these phones are expensive.  it's working good now except the ""finger ID"" isn't working due to latest iOS update but can live with that.  I do like the iPhone 6. Much better than my iPhone 4s I have forever, that is a good solid working phone.

This is the phone you want. With a clear advantage over the previous Iphone 5s and none of the kinks of the new phone, this has the advantage.

I googled it and it looks like I'm not the only one. I don't known if it's because I kept it in my pocket or is it just poor quality of manufacturing. It's not the 6 plus and it didn't bend. I upgraded to 6s and whoa, what a difference. The 6s feels so much more solid. It's heavier and it feels thicker. As far as performance, I can't tell the difference. The battery life however on 6S is the same as on the 6, if not worse. Do yourself a favor and skip the iPhone 6. It's a fragile piece of crap.","3.0 out of 5 stars"

 The iphone 6 is a long lasting, good quality, and durable phone. The phone comes in many varietys of colors, and the Apple company is frequently ugrading the style of the phone.

Concerns:
One of my concerns with the iphone itself is that it is very skinny and can cause the iphone to crack easily if not taken care of properly. If I were you, I would buy a Lifeproof case to prevent the phone from cracking. If the phone cracks, I would bring it to a company so the crack doesn’t grow bigger and ruin your phone entirely. This product is like an ipad but you can text and call on it.
Positives:
The iphone is an apropriate size that can fit in your hand, and it also has a large screen. The camera on the phone can take good quality pictures and videos, leaving you with a fantastic picture. Also the iphone has an excellent battery life, and it can last up to one to two days without needing to be charged. I can use my phone often throughout the day lasting me all day. I prefer people who are older than 10 should have an iphone.
 The iphone 6 is a great phone. I use this product everyday with no problems. It is a high qualitly phone with many beautys that makes my life a lot easier. If I were you, I would go buy the iphone 6 asap.","4.0 out of 5 stars"

I don't know what exactly happened here with apple but this product just has problems. Before anyone starts accusing me of being an Android fan  I want to say that I actually really like iphone over android, I have had both in the past and I prefer iOS when it works properly.

So here is my user experience with this phone, I received this phone a couple months ago, and when I initially got it it worked great, everything was smooth, calls were coming through fine, I liked the design of the phone, I thought it was perfect. About 2 weeks after I received the phone, there was a new iOS update that came out, so I went ahead and downloaded the new update. That is the point that all my problems started. After the update there were two main problems, one was that text messages would never come through for many of my contacts, I just never received them, they said they sent them and I actually looked at the other persons phone and I never got what was sent to me. The other problem that I had was continuously getting dropped and failed calls, I would make 3-4 calls to a person before I finally got it to ring, and even than it would sometimes connect with a lot of static.

I worked extensively with my phone carrier, I called 7-8 times and performed all the same troubleshooting with every technician I spoke with, each call was around 2 hours, some were more, so I probably spent close to 20 hours troubleshooting these issues, I was able to get the phone to operate better by disabling iMessage which helped my texts and than by disabling voice over LTE and just having it be for data. This and I had to reset network settings on my phone, reset the settings and content a couple times, I also had several things that my phone carrier did for me, including registering me to their network again. After all of this was said and done, I greatly reduced the amount of dropped, and failed phone calls and I also received all text messages coming to my phone from that point on. My phone carrier told me I should go to the store and get a new phone, but I didn't because most of the problems were gone and it seemed to be working the way it should

Ok, so issue resolved right? Well, yes with that device, what happened was I had to get a new iPhone, so my iPhone was sitting in a case, and it really wasn't even in my pocket or anything, one day the colors on the bottom right of my screen got dimmer for some reason. So I brought it up to my phone carrier and they looked at it, and they checked for water damage and this and that and said that the phone looks physically fine, and that I would need to go to an apple store and get it replaced. I went to the Apple store and worked with technicians there, they also confirmed what my phone provider said, and were going to replace the screen only, but after looking at my phone they said the button on the side was a little stiff so they said it would be best to replace the phone entirely, well because I was already there and had all those issues in the past I thought my phone just might not have been made correctly and that I have a bad phone so I agreed and got the phone replaced with a brand new one.

I don't know what exactly happened or what they did, the phone was trying to get all of the apps downloaded again that I had on my last phone, it was downloading and installing them for literally 2 days which I thought was really weird. The new phone seemed much better in regards to calls that I was having problems with, but the phone would not open a lot of apps, it would start opening and freeze, than sometimes the screen would turn black and pressing the power button or the home screen would not illuminate your phone. Also holding the power button down when it did this did not do anything to the phone. I figured out a way around it by pressing the power and the home at the same time I think it restarts it and it goes through the loading process. However, sometimes the wifi would also disconnect, than I would go in and try to reconnect, but I wouldn't be able to turn the wifi on through the settings.

So I have had this iPhone 6 since late November, it is now the End of Febuary, Febuary 28th to be precise. That is a good 3 months to try out the phone, and it works and stuff, and I am able to use it, but there are all kinds of glitches that I mentioned above now, related to the screen going out and wifi not connecting and apps not loading or freezing the phone. The problems are not consistant either, so when the phone works it's great, but I've had two of them now, and in both cases I've had different intermittent problems and bugs come up in the last 3 months. Since I waited for a while to make a review I feel that I can really assess the phone.

Most of the people on here give this phone a 5 star rating, blindly rating it. This is not a 5 star phone. I had a iPhone 3GS in the past that I had no problems with at all, than I got an HTC one which I had no real problems with it, but as the device got old the hardware started going so it needed to be replaced and I got this phone now. I think iOS is a much better user interface than Android, but since iOS 8 has come out it is far more buggy than android. The androids may not be as user friendly and might be slightly more complicated to use, and may not get some of the apps or there may be delays or whatever, but the androids worked, the phones stayed on and you could make phone calls and get texts. So my opinion is that Apple really rushed this phone, they did not put in the time or quality that they are known for

Right now my phone seems to be working ok I guess, but the reason I am giving it a one star is because:

1. Quality: The amount of bugs and glitches in this device is not acceptable, the iphone 6 and iphone 6 plus are the most expensive phones on the market right now, customers are paying this amount because they are expecting a higher quality product and are willing to pay for it. When the phone has so many problems with it that it's useless at times, and having problems even after you get a new device that says to me that the devices are not made well.

2. Price: This is one of the most expensive phones on the market and Apple is overcharging for this phone, I felt that I had to get a 64GB phone because it's 2015, 16 GB would fill up immediately when you consider how large the apps are nowadays or how big the pictures are as well.

3. Hardware: As mentioned above, the entry point on this phone is 16GB, I don't think that is acceptable for a premium phone at this point in time. Further, there are real problems when it comes to multitasking because of the lack of memory, this phone comes with only 1GB of RAM, this was fine in the last generation but considering that they're supposed to be competing against Samsung when you compare other premium phones from competitors it's really unacceptable. The S5 by Samsung I would consider it to be the regular iPhone 6's main competitor, it has 2GB of RAM but has been on the market for much longer than the iPhone 6. The Samsung Note 4 is the iPhone 6 plus's main competitor, it came out roughly around the same time the iPhone 6 plus came out, but it has 3 GB of RAM vs 1 GB of RAM, anyone that multitasks or accesses heavily intensive applications is going to notice choppiness especially with future releases of their operating system like iOS 9 and 10 whenever they come out. Considering that an extra gig of RAM would have cost the company at most an extra dollar per model and you are paying hundreds of dollars to begin with this is not ok. Also when you go to the store and you want a 64 GB storage card it doesn't cost hundreds of dollars, so the difference in price between the 16 and 64 GB version should not be $100

4. Customer Service - As I mentioned I have been having a lot of problems with my phone, and I tried getting a new phone through my cellphone provider. If you have similar problems with any other phone by any other brand they will replace your cellphone while it's under warranty right there at the providers store, this is not the case with Apple products though, when an Apple product breaks the company forces the consumer to go to their nearest Apple store and get it addressed there. This is a big inconvenience, because over the life of your phone you may need to get things fixed multiple times, some people live really far away from Apple stores and can't be without their phones so shipping isn't really an option. I don't think a company can act this way to their customers and this in my opinion even though I know it's minor compared to the other things I've mentioned is kinda a big deal for me, I had to drive around town, wait in line at their store, wait at a genius desk or whatever for close to an hour to speak to someone, and than had to go back and do it all over again, I resent the Apple store, because there are not that many and everyone that has an iPhone that needs something fixed is there from every carrier, so it's not like you're in and out of there.

There are a couple of good features on this phone that I will mention, one is the design, it is really nice and sleek, and an elegant look to it, but appearance doesn't mean hardly anything to me after the first 5 minutes especially when the phone doesn't function properly. The second really cool feature is the camera, I read some people that bash this phone and they start talking about the camera and say it's no good, these people do not understand how optics work, the lense is spectacular quality for a phone, you have a f2.2 aperature (the lower the number the more light comes in) this is really unheard of in mobile devices, the people giving bad reviews on the camera compare megapixels, what they don't understand is megapixels hardly mean anything, once you reach 5 megapixels your eyes really can't see more pixels in a photo, so it has plenty, but the image quality and the camera on this phone are really top notch.

With all the being said, if my phone(s) that I got worked and I had no problems with it, I would have rated this phone a 4, because I do value quality, but would deduct a little for price, and the RAM issue because I don't think a premium phone should only have 1GB of ram and find that insulting to the customer, but my phone did have problems and continues to have problems, with the price tag being as high as it is and what people are expecting this phone is a complete let down and disappointment, it's very frustrating to deal with these issues and bugs, and the company needs to release products not on some kind of yearly schedule so it can announce it at a keynote presentation but rather when the product is ready for the market. I want a quality item not something that breaks and has issues with it, otherwise I would have bought a free phone which I would expect to have some problems and be fine with it. The fact that this item has so many problems and is really promoted by every carrier as the best product that they carry is absurd.","1.0 out of 5 stars"

I can text, talk, or FaceTime on my mac close it down in the middle of a conversation and continue that conversation on my iPhone.

Beware that the out of warranty price at the writing of this review is $299 for the iPhone should the screen crack. I searched around for a cheaper alternative when my son's phone dropped and shattered in the first week. The cheapest non-apple alternative I could find was $330 because the part alone is nearly $300. I was surprised that by merely falling out of a pocket the phone looked like it exploded. We've had iPhone 4, 4s, and 5s where they fell and the screen cracked (and more times where no crack showed). For whatever reason, the iPhone 6 seems extremely fragile. The guys at apple were understanding but admitted that they're seeing a lot more come in with damage than prior models.","3.0 out of 5 stars"

The front camera lacks a lot of the quality compared to the photos you can take with the regular camera but it's better than having none. The app market is fast growing and always changing which is a huge win for this phone. Battery life isn't as long as you'll wish it were, specially considering the amount of apps you""ll be running daily and the time you'll spend in the phone overall.  The phone is so thin you'll barely feel it in your pocket which is a huge plus in some situations. In the beginning many complained about them bending but it has proven to be stronger than that. It has fallen a multiple of times and the screen hasn't cracked so far so it proves at least some resistance without cover. It is easy to use, even when slightly bigger than its predecessor it offers, what I like to call the ""screen reacher"". This feature allows you, when using only one hand, to double tap the home button and the screen shifts down allowing you to reach with your thumb the apps or information the phone held on the top corner. The fingerprint safety lock allows you to not only leave a passcode but also to have your phone reachable with just the tap of your fingerprint. Extremely useful.

Overall it is a fantastic phone. Personally, I am more of a camera spec person and would love Apple to bring forth a phone with a camera to blow our minds off but this phone, as it is, is extremely good. A definite upgrade from the iPhone 5. Just as user friendly.","4.0 out of 5 stars"

I've owned iPhones and Android phones. While a lot can be said of the nice features of iPhone, the lack of a ""Back"" button shows how stupidly arrogant Apple is and how it's sacrificing user experience for its bloated ego. Android and Windows mobile operating systems both have the ""Back"" button for a reason - the Back button is the easiest, most often used and most natural way to navigate in almost all apps. Apply doesn't add this function for no other reason than it doesn't want to admit it needs to learn a thing or two from others. There is Back button in iPhone Safari browser and some other apps, but each app may have this function at a different location, so users have to look for it each time. A Back button built into the operating system as in Android and Windows is obviously more convenient and natural. But Apple's ego is too large to go ""Back"" to fix this issue. Again, that's STUPIDLY arrogant. I'll never buy another Apply product until it learns a little modesty and make its product better for customers, not its ego!

- Update in response to a comment from another user on my review

The user (obviously an Apple fan) said that all iPhone apps have some sort of ""Back"" function tied to the iOS navigation requirement. But that's exactly the problem. Each app builds the ""Back"" function differently, and the location varies from app to app. In Android and Windows, the Back button is always conveniently at the bottom of the phone, so one-hand operation is easy and natural. But on iPhone, even before the larger iPhone 6, it's almost impossible to easily navigate with one hand. And one simple touch to go ""Back"" in Android and Windows usually requires two or more moves. The really sad thing about iPhone is a commercial product turned into a religion. Apple fans blindly follow it without any rational thinking. I'm definitely not saying Android is perfect, but if Apple can't add a convenient, natural navigation function (which is obviously easy for it to do), it says something about its mentality. Apple fans may feel proud of all the tricks in navigating iPhone, but isn't iOS supposed to be the most intuitive and simple to use? Think of another difference between iPhone and Android phones. In Android, users can either set display brightness to ""auto"", or manually adjust it. In iPhone, iOS automatically adjusts the brightness, users have no choice. Apple fans would say iOS makes it simple so users don't need to adjust it. Android also has the default ""auto"" feature so users don't need to adjust it. But the difference is Android gives users the choice just in case users need to. And you know what? The universe has so many possibilities that some time the auto brightness doesn't fit a particular situation! Apple regards itself to be the master of the universe, while Android and Windows know there are limitations to whatever geniuses can foresee.
All I'm trying to say is, if you love iPhone, love it rationally, at least look what's out there in the wider world and make an informed decision.","1.0 out of 5 stars"

My iPhone 6 was a Christmas present but I got it 3 weeks early thinking they would sell out for the holidays. My dad, mom, sister, and me all got the iPhone 6. When they first handed me my phone I felt like I wasn't holding a phone. I felt like I was holding something out of this world. And that's what Apple does every time they make a product. They make sure you will love it till the end. Whenever you get a new iPhone, no matter what generation, you will be holding something that is worth its pricing. Some might say, oh the iPhone is too expensive, but if they made the effort to get one, they would understand it's not too expensive. Its pricing is just fine. I upgraded from the iPhone 4s to the iPhone 6. That's a big upgrade. All I can say is I really recommend the new iPhone 6. You will love it just as much as I do.","5.0 out of 5 stars"

It is a fantastic piece of creation from Apple. Before I sound too obsessed with my Apple I-Phone 6, let me straight away tell you why. Android as a platform from Google has become a rage and being used as free universal platform. But off late it has been exposed to a number of threats and security flaws. The different versions are tweaked and their operating codes are easily accessed. Apple I phone is difficult to crack in that sense. Its software is more robust and comes with an exclusive range of features which separates you from the masses. I think Apple I phone is every worth of the penny it costs.
I recommend Apple I- phone to all the mobile users who have advanced smart phone needs and wants to separate them from the herd mentality. Some of the key features of this beautifully designed phone are the gold texture, the 16 Gb internal memory which is quite adequate for all sorts of storage applications. Its 1 Gb ram and an 8 megapixel camera give a superior experience. What brings success for Apple I-phone 6 and is a game changer is the iOS 8, Dual-Core 1.4 GHz Cyclone (ARM v8-based) Processor which provides superior graphics to the device. This dual core processer speed is visible when multiple applications are being played on the device. I found the switching between applications to be extremely smooth.
As soon as you will get this device you will be hooked on to it and will love to flaunt it.","5.0 out of 5 stars"

All my relatives own Iphones though, and two of them have 6's. What I've noticed is that three primary functions of the Iphone 6's, phone, camera, and storage,  are of noticeably inferior quality compared to my old Nokia Lumia 520 ($40)and  my new dual sim unlocked Nokia 530 ($80).

Phone: The call sound quality on the 6's is HORRIBLE compared to the Nokias, regardless of location. The primary purpose of a phone is to make calls, right? I often make my relatives hang up and call on their land lines. It's that bad. My wife is a flight attendant, and calls home from all over the US on the Nokia 520. The call quality is usually better than land line. I'm not exaggerating in either case.

Photos: We go on vacation to Yosemite with the relatives. They're shooting photos with their 6's, us with our 520's, at the exact same times and locations. The photos get uploaded to Facebook. Across the board, the Iphone photo's are of substantially inferior quality to the Nokia photo's. I think this may have something to do with the thickness of the phones, and what that does to the lens design.  I've seen a number of articles on the Internet comparing and touting Iphone photo quality. All I know is what what I actually see myself.

Storage: OK, this is no secret. There's no SD card slot on Iphones. You pay through the nose up front, or you're stuck. Our Nokia's have micro SD card slots just like other phones.

I really don't get it. People literally pay ten times the money for a product that doesn't perform it's most basic functions satisfactorily. Yes, I know, there's all these wonderful apps available for the Iphone, and Iphones are so slim and sexy. I'll take the sound and photo quality of the Nokia.","2.0 out of 5 stars"

Seriously love this iphone! I've had an iPhone pretty much since ever, I started with an android back in 2010 (my first phone and I was about 18 years old) but it was a piece of poop so I decided to buy an iPhone 4 in 2011, and I've been in love with it since then! But in 2013 I was like ""oh what the heck, why not make a change? I'll just get an android"" so I (was indeed stupid) traded my iPhone 4s at the time, with a galaxy s3 and boy did I regret it. It lagged and it was the worst camera I've seen! Now I understand that since it was 2 years ago, technology has become better but I still don't trust androids at all! I'm scared they'll let me down. And for s 2 year contract I don't wanna waste money. I love iPhones :) they're classic, beautiful and just amazing quality! #teamapple","5.0 out of 5 stars"

Coming from the iPhone 4, I like that the 6 is ""exactly"" like it only taller, lighter, slimmer and much faster. I can't give it more stars (My actual rating would be 3 1/2) because I don't understand why they put the headphone jack on the bottom???? Which, would be ok IF the iTunes app orientated upside down!!!! It doesn't orientate upside down, unless I totally missed something and I tried.  They also moved the power button to the right side opposite the volume up button, so that when I power off, until I get used to it, I'm also pressing the volume up.  In other words, had they kept the power button and the headphone jack as it was on the 4, I would have given it a 5.

Other features I really like is the keyboard that has the text helper above it.  The microphone function is sweet too, and I'm using it right now as I am talking this text.  It is accurate.  The camera is very sharp.  I do like the size of the 6 as it fits in my hand nicely. Considered the 6+ but don't want the bulk of a 6+ with a case.

But it's unreliable in its basic function of making and receiving voice calls (and texts).  I'm in my 18th month of a 2-year Verizon contract; to Verizon's credit, they have twice replaced my iPhone6 now for free - I'm hoping the third iPhone will last to the end of the contract. Yes, this was after trying everything else (replacing SIM card, wiping phone and restoring it from iCloud, and btw, always keep it backed up to iCloud). And yes, I'm grateful to Verizon for openly acknowledging how unreliable this device is and just replacing it free. That said, many of us depend on having a working phone and texting service at all times, and having to go for a few days without phone/ text service can be annoying at least and potentially risky. If you do go with an iPhone6, be sure to have a land line or tracfone on hand (I have the latter) for those several-day periods when your no-longer-functional iPhone 6 is being replaced by a new one - figure these will happen annually. NOTE TO PROVIDERS: there's a market opening for one of you who will give customers a ""loaner"" phone during periods when the phone is being replaced. FOOTNOTE: this warning is specifically about the iPhone6; Verizon tells me that the iphone5 series and iPhone6s models are more reliable. FOOTNOTE: again, all the other functions of the phone work fine, such as wifi. It loses the ability to do cellular calls or texting but these other things still work. FURTHER FOOTNOTE: AppleCare is a must for all these reasons.","3.0 out of 5 stars"

The iPhone 6 has tons of awesome apps and features plus it’s great quality. Are you looking for a great quality phone that has awesome features and more?

The number one reason that it’s a great phone is that it’s great quality. It has a really clear display and it’s smooth working meaning it doesn’t take long to load. I found a quote from a trusted website that said, “The iPhone 6 has a pretty good display. It also runs pretty smoothly.”

On top of that, it has many cool features. It includes image stabilization, has mote sensors, and it has Apple Pay.  I found another quote that states, “The iPhone 6 has many features including optical image stabilization, Apple Pay, including more sensors.

Some people claim that the iPhone 6 has little battery power and doesn’t have that many color choices. It actually does have good battery life depending on how long you use it throughout the day. For example, if you are on your phone constantly throughout the day, then the battery power probably wont keep up that long, but if you are on it a descent amount of times in between, the battery power will last a lot longer. The color choices are the other negative topic some people talk about. The colors include silver, gold, and space gray. Even though there are only three phone colors, there are a variety of colored phone cases apple caries including others.","5.0 out of 5 stars"

I have used I-phone 4, Iphone4s,Iphone 5,Iphone 5s, Apple TV, IPAD 2, and IPAD mini. My first apple product I-Phone 4 is still working. Apple has changed since then especially after Steve Jobs. I think new products are unreliable. I am upset because I am getting ready to bury my I-Phone 5 because it turned off without a reason and now apple associate calls it a ""dead unit."" I have been using it for one and half years. I took care of it very nicely. On Monday it turned off randomly couple times, i restored it and it did not help either. Now it is not turning on. I took it to Apple store and they said that it is dead unit and out of warranty that i should have bought extended warranty. It is frustrating since i did not use at least for two years.

If you are planing to buy I-Phone 5 or I-Phone 6, think twice. I am done with apple products, not buying I-Phones any more. If you are buying I-Phone 6, you are good at least for a year (limited warranty).","1.0 out of 5 stars"

When the iPhone 6 came out, we all thought the size was a little bit big - but I absolutely love having a larger screen! It makes watching videos, using Instagram and editing photos SO much more enjoyable! My one drawback to this phone, which is pretty major in my opinion, is how the camera lens protrudes from the back of the phone. Basically, without a case, your phone is sitting right on the camera when it is set down. This is ridiculous to me. It took me a few weeks to decide on which case I wanted to purchase for my iPhone 6 and by the time I decided on the Lifeproof case, my camera had cracked. Overall I am in love with my iPhone 6; I absolutely love the new design and adore the gold color which is super classy and beautiful. However, Apple really dropped the bomb by not protecting the lens more on a $1000 phone. I'm bummed by the fact that I have this amazing phone that now has a cracked camera.","4.0 out of 5 stars"

Apple has created such a brand with last year's technologies to lure people. While Samsung, LG, Motorola and other top Android manufacturers are pushing the limit of smart phone technologies, Apple has lagged behind for 1 year on the hardware front and 2 years on the software front with Google. I wrote another review regarding the camera comparison between iPhone 6, 6+, and LG G3. The photo samples are at https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B-mVIvj6SluAM0YzRGNZT0g5Snc&usp=sharing. While iPhone 6 and 6+'s camera has done better in the low light than LG G3, iPhone 6's camera captured completely blurred license plate numbers compared to the other 2 phones. That was embarrassing losing so much details. Samsung Galaxy S5 might have a better chance winning the low light test with iPhone 6 but the mountain picture shows the lack of details on the trees from iPhone 6's camera compared to LG G3's. I was able to see the differences from the phones and have another hiker who owned iPhone 6+ to verify them. The differences are more obvious if viewed on PC with large monitors. Not everything is bad about the camera, iPhone 6's camera actually did well capturing text in low light. Check the picture that has a yellow Chinese book. Zoom in and you'd see the text more clear than LG G3's. The file names tell you which picture belongs to which device.

 On the software side, Apple finally allow accessing iCloud data via iCloud Drive following what Google did years back. So it's playing catchup. However, my test of iCloud backup failed intermittently. Most of the iOS 8 features are following Google's Android 4.4 or barely matching it. Some people may think having a fingerprint sensor makes the device more secure. Definitely not. If fingerprint unlock fails, it reverts to PIN unlock. Anyone who knows possible PIN numbers can unlock your iPhone 6 by bypassing the fingerprint unlock screen. I found this because the fingerprint unlock worked 45% of the time on me. What could be more embarrassing if you use Apple pay but fails. I will for sure be the customer in line next to the failed Apple pay user yelling ""get out, there are more people behind me trying to checkout"".

 There are a few design decisions that make iOS 8 quite annoying. The most is mandatory password entry installing free apps. Android does not require that. One reason I can think of may be Apple does not want user to forget Apple ID's password. I've seen Android users fail to remember its Gmail password. Those dump ones are not using Google's string service back end and are usually the victims of converting to buying iPhones.

 The other less annoying design decision is that it requires user touching OK for ""[App] would like to access your [location/photo/etc…]"". I had to touch OK at every prompt. I can't think of practical uses of not allowing the app to do its functionality. If you don't trust the app, maybe you should not have downloaded it. I've seen a user choosing not allow for Google search/maps resulting in find a Starbucks 1000 miles away (useless search result). The user was misled that someone was trying to snoop on her. Android takes a different approach showing users the access permissions at app download time. Which eliminates the needs to asking users for permission at each turn.

 I believe the true price for iPhone 6 should be $400, not $650. The screen to body ratio is another sign of inferior hardware engineering. The top part of the phone from the edge of the screen to the top end measured in length is wider than LG G3. Such length is even wide on iPhone 6+. Apple should have pushed the screen edge to the top end  of the phone. Such tiny space could only allow putting a speaker and a front camera. LG G2, G3 did it. But Apple failed. Remember Apple bought the IPS LCD screen from LG and have Foxconn assemble it. The pixel resolution for iPhone 6 is 720p, 6+: 1080p, LG G3: 1440p","1.0 out of 5 stars"

In fact, I will probably never buy another iPhone. I dropped my 6 at most two feet after about three weeks of ownership. It landed on the back of the phone, yet somehow the glass shattered. I've had two friends with the same issue. Mind you, I should've bought a case. But what's the point of a ""sleek"" and ""thin"" phone if you have to put a bulky case on it to protect it? I've dropped my other iPhones from higher distances on harder surfaces with almost no damage (and no damage to the screen at all).

Then, I bought a kit to fix it. I'm not much of a techy, but I broke down the phone to the last step (after hours of work...again because I'm slow) only to realize there is not way to fix the screen. The glass and touch screen panel are fused together. You cannot fix your phone without sending it back to Apple for a couple hundred bucks!!! Meanwhile, Droids are very easy to fix. I've seen it done a few times. It's as if Android cares about things like easy repairs whereas Apple wants you to fork out more money. I find this to go against everything the company used to stand for or at least what we were told Apple stands for - caring about the end user/customer.

Anyhow, the phone is probably fine if you get a case right away. If not, be very careful with it because the slightest knock off a table will likely crack the glass.

Oh and Apple won't care about your issue. They've cornered the market in the US, so an unhappy customer here and there doesn't matter. Not when they can keep running those same commercials over and over again about how great it is.","1.0 out of 5 stars"

After calling Apple and resetting the phone 4 times with Apple specialist the phone would not turn on. Charged it but signal would not turn on and screen never lite up. The back was chipped on the bottom right corner. Not the phone chipped just the phone was dented. Sorry about this review but it's true and I couldn't hold it in I had to throw the towel in.","1.0 out of 5 stars"
