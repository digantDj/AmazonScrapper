Screen, sound, Battery and functions all were aces. Replaced a Google Moto phone that was not a good story. Bigger that what I replaced, but getting old & easier to see & type. Only issues so far...1) was able to transfer old contacts and information using Google account...Worked like a charm. Did not have as much luck with Samsung & Motorola transfer aps. Have not figured out a way to transfer the music & photos, but am working on it.
 2) The phone was advertised as ""UNLocked"" I plugged-in the old sim card from my past phone (RIP) & I was able to use it immediately as a phone, but it would not use data functions reliably & finally quit altogether. I called my Carrier  (Consumer Cellular-GREAT) and they tried to walk me through a network change...No luck.. the phone was set for a Cingular account & we could not determine how to change it. I contacted the seller, and after 2 tries, was sent correct network information & ""how-to"" links to change the carrier.
It was more than I had ever done to make a phone work, but for the price, if you can get correct network settings for your data, it is a great phone.
Seller was responsive.","4.0 out of 5 stars"

The beauty of this phone is the ease of setup. I swapped in my SIM card, my SD card, turned it on and signed into my Google account. All my contacts, text messages, apps, settings, even phone history all transferred automatically in less that 10 minutes.
This works easily as well as my S3 and it's nice to have a newer phone with a nice bright screen and great battery life.

The first 6 weeks it worked very well but now, it is constantly sticking and takes a long time to respond to selections made. I am not happy at all. I only really use my phone for calls, whatsapp and picture taking and because the screen sticks taking pictures is a waste of time because the subject has often moved before the image has captured.
I feel like they send inferior unlocked phones out because they are not generally staying in the US so by the time the phone is received and starts acting up we cannot return them. I ordered this phone before and when I got it back to the Caribbean it wouldn't connect to a network. I thought I'd try again ordering another one as that one must have been a flook, but I would love to return this one if I could and buy something locally because using this one is getting more frustrating by the day.

1.  Videos won't play on social media.  I only hear the sound.
2.  The volume on the phone is too low
3.  At times when I press texting keys, the phone freezes up and I have to keep pressing the keys before it will enter the character.
4.  The phone goes in and out between 3G and 4G (which I think is related to the videos on social media not playing).
5.  I'm not able to add and save multiple phone numbers from a text message into my contacts.

I am now reluctant to purchase electronics from the internet.

All the apps are an upgrade over my old Android phone and the sound quality is very good. The 8 MP camera takes great pictures and video.

I have only two issues with the phone. First, and most serious, it does not support transfer of files via USB cable (USB OTG). When you plug it into your computer via USB, it will only charge. This feature has been so standard on my other Android devices up to this point, including two smartphones and a Kindle Fire, that it's not the kind of feature I would think to verify before purchase so I want people to know that THIS PHONE DOES NOT SUPPORT FILE TRANSFER VIA USB. That means that you can't transfer your MP3 collection or large numbers of photos via USB. If that's not an issue for you, that's fine, and it's not a huge issue for me but it was an unpleasant surprise.

The other issue is minor - I would have preferred to see the Back button on the other side of the phone. Because of its placement and the light weight of the phone, it's hard for me to reach the button with my thumb without dropping the phone.

Otherwise, it seems like a great budget Android phone so far.","4.0 out of 5 stars"

Adding additional programs is an issue because they would rather be on the internal memory instead of the external memory  and there is very little.  16 GB would be much nicer.  One last issue would be registering this device with Samsung for the warranty.  Apparently this device is meant to be sold in another country so registering it here in the USA is not possible.  Samsung sent me a link to register the device for other countries but, I don't know what country to select.  With that said, it has not been registered with Samsung.

sluggish, and it becomes laggy a lot.

Everything was there and I 'm using it on tracfone so if you're wondering it will work there. My concerns were that it would cost me but turn on WiFi only and turn off Data, I send texts using gmail and make calls using hangout dialer. So the only time this costs me anything is when I accept a text message or accept a phone call. Even then I can see who it is and call them back for free using dialer, I also have Majik jack as another backup for free calls.  My last phone with tracfone cost me about $80 a YEAR so I figure this one should be about the same. The phone itself has 2 Sim card slots so you could have 2 phone numbers if you want or if traveling out of the country just buy a 2nd sim for the country you are visiting. I added the 128g SD card so have lots of room there, just wish more android apps would transfer over without rooting, which I DID NOT do. Camera, Video and GPS are very good and overall I would recommend this phone.","5.0 out of 5 stars"

Two months and it totally crashed, overheating in my hand and going to black! First it came set up for Great Britain. Had to learn to switch it to American English. Not friendly at all. Finally, I got it where I thought it was at least useful and then it died. Amazon has promised a refund. I've always had Samsung phones but think this should be pulled from the market. I learned, after checking on the black screen/over heating issue that this is a known problem. In my case, it totally burned out the phone. None of the work arounds for an overheated phone worked. Would not take a charge in any way shape or form. Recommend finding another phone. I did because I am totally smart phone dependent because I travel.

For the price, it feels very well constructed. The screen resolution is decent enough to view pictures, play games and watch videos.
The response on the phone is snappy. Be sure to keep your internal memory free as much possible, you will slow down the phone if you have too many items. Since it does have an option to add a micro SD card, be sure to use as much possible to avoid running out of space in your internal storage.
Overall the phone is very good and i recommend it.","5.0 out of 5 stars"

I had to downgrade because of the product's performance. It worked well for a couple of months, but after that there are a lot of issues with this phone.  It keeps restarting, it restarts in the middle of typing an email, or text message, or doing something important, this is so frustrating.  I had to wait for it to restart & start all over again. Some apps do not work at all, I cannot open them at all, if I do, the phone will hang & restart.  These apps are not third party, they are downloaded from Google play.  Well, I guess that is what you get for this price.  I would certainly not recommend this phone to anyone who wants to do a few more things other than just reading email, listening to music & watching videos.","1.0 out of 5 stars"

That is to say, if you want your phone to use your home wifi as a priority over cell line for phone calls, this is a different model.  A very slightly differently numbered model with the same friggin' name but a different model.  You'll have to spring for the one on the Tmobile website (at greater expense) as of Aug. 2015 if you want 4g and wifi calling.  Sending this one back.

I am a T-mobile prepaid customer and I wanted to the 4GLTE and wifi calling capability. The fact that they had pre-installed DEVICE UNLOCK is a plus! My previous smartphones were: Iphone 4, Samsung Galaxy Note 2 and BLU HD. I also have an international phone/tablet with a cellular radio (Samsung Galaxy Tab S 8.4) I’ve moved on from Iphone/Ios since they have no external storage and your reliance on Itunes software. I loved my Samsung Galaxy Note 2 but unfortunately it died on me after about 2 years. (My Iphone 4 is actually still working as well as my IPAD 2) I bought the Galaxy Note 2 from Ebay supposedly brand new and for about $600. I don’t know if I got a lemon or I was just using too much or what. But I’ve decided not to buy super expensive phones anymore as I really don’t use all the apps on the phone often and use my tablets for that. I got an inexpensive BLU HD phone which had really nice screen and 1080P, DUAL SIM and all that but the buttons, the camera it was all just placed wrong and didn’t act nicely/comfortably. The dual sim feature slightly sucked too as it had restrictions.  Then when I saw the low price on the Prime, I got it. Everything feels and works just like my expensive Samsung tablets. But one of the cons is that its only 8GB internal storage. But I understand because of the low price. It has a MICRO SD slot so who cares. I still have to test if it will accept a 128gb microsd card. I think it should if its like any other Samsung phone/tabelts. I only put my most important apps that I REALLY use often and left 2GB of internal space left. For other apps that I cannot uninstall I did not install their updates since I don’t use them anyway. Their camera and video recording seems acceptable and I would only use it in a pinch. (I prefer to use my Canon DSLR and camcorder now) I don’t really see any slow performance at the moment. (I like to use the Waze GPS apps and possibly the internet and Hangouts) Now the cream dela crème for me is the DEVICE UNLOCK. I did the temporary unlock and sure enough it worked and I was able to put my ATT sim card in there! The Temporary Unlock is only good for 30 days. There is also a PERMANENT UNLOCK option which I tried but it didn’t work for me. Supposedly I have to put in at least $100 in refill (since I’m a prepaid customer) or 4 months of usage. So whichever options come first I’ll be sure to use the permanent unlock whenever that time comes. Otherwise I love the Galaxy Grand Prime. If you buy it for less than $200 like me, I think its worth it!","4.0 out of 5 stars"

pros; nice size display screen, takes great pictures and plenty of storage once you add a memory card, easy setup for any carrier, and lots of storage space for apps.
cons: freezes up and turns off unexpectedly even though it says it has the latest software update, shabby charger that is pieced together

I was getting tired of carrying around two handsets, one for personal and one for business. AT&T is my wireless provider and I took the three handsets to the store and they got the two sim cards installed and activated in the new handset pretty quickly.

I had to install custom ring tones to distinguish the two lines because the visual cues are too subtle and I haven't figured out how to change that.

For my personal line I was converting from iPhone to android, so I tried to follow instructions I found online to transfer my pictures, contacts, and text conversations from the iPhone to the new device. However, somewhere in the process things quit working and I had to perform a factory reset. Following the factory reset at after about two weeks of moderate use, I haven't even finished acquiring all the apps I use, it became slow and glitchy. I have to restart the phone at least once a day. I hope the OTA Lollipop update comes soon and fixes these problems; after the earlier glitch I am reluctant to root the phone and perform the update manually.

After several months of use I consider the phone call quality to be pretty terrible. I don't know how much of that is attributable to the handset and the network, but every conversation involves asking people to repeat themselves because of garbled interference from the network/device. I've only used the device in the lower 48 states and it's ability to detect signals is hit or miss. Sometimes one sim card will have no bars but the other will have four bars. It's the same provider for both sim cards so I'm inclined to say that is a handset issue rather than a network issue.","3.0 out of 5 stars"
"","","Why don't I like it?  Because every day it goes dead and I have to pry the back off, take out the battery, wait for a few seconds, and then reinsert it and reboot the phone.  I have missed I don't know how many calls when it goes out to lunch like this.  I have a colleague who is having the EXACT same problem with her Samsung phone, which is a twin of mine.  Change the battery?  I have, twice, both times purchasing an OEM battery, and still experiencing the same issue.  It's maddening when my phone ""dies"" and I don't even know about it!!!!!  I used to think Samsung was a pretty good phone - this is my second - but NO MORE SAMSUNG ANYTHING IN MY HOME!!!!!","2.0 out of 5 stars"

I have had it for a few months and have gotten questionable use out of it, to say the least. At the time of purchase it sounded like a good phone, especially given that I cannot exactly afford the more expensive phones from Samsung. When I first got it, the phone worked like a charm, and was amazing. However, after having it a short while, I began to have major issues with freezing. When connected to the internet, it becomes extremely slow, and I often had to restart it by removing the battery. I also found out later that the ""8GB"" disk space your supposed to get is much closer to 5.5GB, which fills up very quick, contributing to the extensive lagging. I cannot return the phone, so I am going to get the most mileage I can out of it, and try to keep it offline as much as possible. It really is a shame that these issues make me dislike it as much as I do, since it does have a very nice screen resolution, two VERY nice cameras, and great speaker and call quality. It would make a great starter phone for your teen, but if you are one who uses your phone a lot, especially if it requires much internet, I would say keep shopping.","3.0 out of 5 stars"

PROS:
1. Nice looking phone
2. Cheap- good value for money for a non-power user
3. Excellent battery life - Easily lasts all day with moderate to heavy use
4. Nice videos in good lighting - the only redeeming quality of the camera

CONS:
1. Slow with multi-tasking. Easily bogged down.
2. Camera - poor image quality in low light. Hit or miss in normal condition
3. Finicky cellular radio reception issues. For some reason, the phone will go into a sleep mode and drop all cellular connections at random. It will take 2-3 minutes for cellular reception to return.
4. Android Navigation buttons are not backlit.

This is a factory unlocked phone and should not have any locks on the phone.  Please have them call their service provider in their country so that they can help them to setup the data settings.  Please advise.

The service provider stated the they cannot unlock the data a it was done at the factory.

One lasted a week before shattering the glass despite having an otterbox. I was tired of shelling out money to replace it. After making the switch to android and samsung from apple, I suggested he do the same. He's obsessed with all the extra stuff you can do with android that you could not with apple. Plus the storage is expandable.  I kept my 4s for years until it wouldn't hold anything unless I wiped it. I decided to go with a Samsung Note 5. It's so much better.

I like this phone except for the fact that photos on fb etc are not clear.  There is an outline of the image but a bright light on the rest of the photo so you can't make anything out.

I however realized that the phone had the most updated system.  I'm returning this phone!!

UPDATE:

Because of that, this phones feature of having the ability to use a 64MB external SD card to supplement the 8MB internal storage is a smoke & mirror trick for the unknowing. Of course Samsung will not allow Cricket to have Android 5.0+ Lollipop on the phone (if it can even handle it) because that would be competition for Samsung's other higher priced phones that get better profit margins. Shame on Cricket (AKA AT&T) for even offering this phone to its customers. Nobody will likely be happy with this phone unless the have no plans on installing maybe 5 apps of their choice.

Siri never knew what I was saying..EVER! In 2 years, she never understood one thing! This phone, with ""OK Google"" understands everything I say!! This came with some sort of European plug with  US adapter and that has not worked out very well--this is something to be aware of but you can request a proper plug if you do not get one for the US.

I'm price conscious. I don't consume massive 4G data etc., but I certainly can appreciate youtube consumption via wifi on the occasion.

 I believe you can feel satisfied in most everything.
The brand is good.
I will avoid... ""at all costs"" proprietary branded cellphones,
as much as possible, which is why I'm avoiding Blu phones, I don't want to risk google and Amazon running my phone
and I feel it necessary to mention Blu phones,
I've tried so many products I feel
that I don't want to take that risk,
since I'm not that broke
but I don't wanna throw my money around.

There comes a point where phones just get more expensive because the specs are overkill.
The industry has been gone forward enough,
a phone like this with more than recent and essential specs (imo)
came be sold out, at a reasonable price
(not tied to a contract, factory unlocked, dual sim)

150$ is still a stretch for me,
I bought a Iphone 4 last year (it's 2015)
60bucks. This phone is really is
more than all you honestly need
and satisfied all that I really could want.

anything more really is premium.
Anything less is hard to justify
up to 60$70$ which I got iphone 4 used for.
I'm very much more than happy","5.0 out of 5 stars"

I bought the gold one and it is really pretty. It functions the same as my Samsung Galaxy s4, s5 and almost any other Samsung as far as functionality goes. The system seems to be set up the same for my basic purposes at quite a fraction of the cost. The last s5 I bought cost close to 800 dollars and I am way happier with this cheaper phone than I was with the s5. I watch videos, make phone calls, text, Facebook, snap chat and online shopping of course with hardly any issues.
This issues I have had so far is that for some reason my backspace button on my keyboard is finicky. I have even tried downloading a different keyboard app and I still have the same issue. I don't know if it's an issue with the screen or what. Also for some reason snap chat videos shows a green line to the far left of the screen, it doesn't really disrupt anything it's just odd that it's there. Last thing is that for some reason I can't get mms messages to go out or come in which can be extremely frustrating. I don't know if a technical support could help me with these issues or not. I've always had contract phones so I don't really know how customer support goes for a phone that's not on contract.
I would definitely make this purchase again. Even with the little glitches, this is a good name brand phone and worth the money spent on it. I just hope that somehow I can smooth out the glitches to prevent further inconvenience. Hope this helps.","4.0 out of 5 stars"

Before purchasing this SUPERB phone, I had the Galaxy Grand (original) yet it was time to upgrade with another 5 inch screen phone and for me, this phone is still a very nice phone even one year later!
My goal in this review is to give you the reasons why I love this phone and recommend it!

Before I begin the PROS and CONS I wanted you to know that the phone that I received the Grand Prime SM-G530H/DS, and it will work on these: Quad-Band 850/900/1800/1900.n
**** This the United States version (US) and it is unlocked to work in the United States, Canada, Mexico, Central America with a US Sim card inside this. On the box it was stated this info: AMERICAN SIM CARD ONLY: This phone is compatible with a Sim card from the Americas (The North, The South, Central America and the Caribbean).
****It also states that the American Sim card can call overseas from American Operators, so this is NOT AN INTERNATIONAL PHONE, HOWEVER IT IS A US unlocked phone for any US Sim card.
Since I do not plan on going out of the United States, this is OK with me, however, if you need a phone to take outside of the US, South America or the Caribbean, (if you plan on traveling to Europe etc) I suggest that you purchase an  UNLOCKED / INTERNATIONAL phone.

PROS:

+ Lollipop update Info: My phone updated and when it started the update, it showed the update would take over 500 mg or 1/2 gig of internal space, this is a lot of internal space. However, after the update, I had still had  2.8 gigs internal left and since I have apps Facebook, Twitter, and the Kindle app and a few other personal apps that I use, I was happy to have 2.8 gigs to add other apps later on if needed. Before you update to Lollipop, know it does take up over 500 megs of space to install, update on the phone.
****In my opinion after the Lollipop update, my phone runs very well and I like the new features of Lollipop.

+ SIZE AND WEIGHT: Perfect size considering the fact that it has the 5 inch screen. It fits easily into my smallest purse. And I purchased a leather vertical case that clips to my waistband so I take it with me to the gym to listen to my music or radio when I work out. Because the phone is so light, I carry it easily on my jeans with the pouch/case that I purchased for the phone.

+ Camera - This has a 8MP camera and I am amazed at the clarity of the pictures that I have taken with phone. For example, I took a close up of a greenish/multi-colored leaf and each vein of the leaf was very sharp and also vivid in color. Then I took outdoor shots of a few things around my home, indoor shots of special foods that I prepared and the results were truly amazing.

+ Screen Resolution - For me personally, I find the resolution (at 220 PPI - Pixels Per Inch) GOOD to VERY GOOD and I find that this screen is very VIVID and CLEAR AND EASY TO READ. In fact, webpages and my Kindle Reading app are just stunning on this phone!  *All of my pictures and videos are crystal clear with this phone.

+ WiFi/3G (Internet): Connects to any WiFi and the signal strength is excellent (even in the very back of my home and outside), most of the time I have 4 bars (outside is 2.5 bars). When not near a router or WiFi hotspot, I use AT&T for data and easily get 3G and I have gotten 3G+ (there is no 4G in my area). The data is very fast, almost as fast as my home WiFi is.

+ Temperature of the battery and of the phone - This phone and battery runs very cool and normal temp and most of the time it is running at 78 degrees to 87 degrees. When I download lots of apps or play games, it may get up to 91 degrees for a couple of minutes but goes right down to normal temps. This phone DOES NOT OVERHEAT. I have read that some newer smart phones will sometimes get up as high as 112 degrees, this one for me has not done this.
It is important to keep a phone running cooler as it will prolong the life of the phone and it is easier on the battery as well.

+  Phone call clarity etc. - No matter what my location using this phone for phone calls the clarity of calls is loud and clear whether on the phone's speaker, headset etc. I even had to turn down the volume quite a lot as the calls come in so well.

+  Overall speed, performance, smoothness, picture quality of the screen--very, very fast and peppy. And I found a way to SAVE on both memory and on battery. * Since updating to Lollipop, the phone is very responsive and I am so pleased with the phone.

+ BATTERY LIFE: This phone has given me the BEST battery life of ANY smartphone or that I ever owned. And I use 100% brightness. For me, even at 100 brightness, if I use WiFi or Data just when I need it and then turn it off, I get all day into the night on one single charge! (I charge nightly and the phone is at 100% ready to go the next morning).

+ EXTERNAL SLOT FOR MICRO SD CARD (UP TO 64GB SD CARD) - I placed a SanDisk 64 SD card and it works great with this phone. This helped to sell me on this phone as I can add my personal music, photos, videos and more to this phone! (I placed a 64GB SD Card in this phone and I still have lots of room left).

*Keep in mind where External SD cards are concerned: They are JUST for your personal files: music, videos, photos, and other files. When you install apps from Playstore or other sources, they store either in INTERNAL Memory Card or sometimes in the phone area (most store in the INTERNAL SD AREA). This is the law of the land where Android is concerned and ALL newer Android devices (including Samsung) work this way when storing your downloaded apps are concerned.

+ INTERNAL STORAGE SPACE:
This phone is advertised at 8GB of Internal space. The 8GB is the space BEFORE the drive was formatted, OS installed and then factory apps installed. So what I had on the phone BEFORE I installed any apps it had 4.5 GB left. This is how it is on any flash drive, SD card, Hard Drive as formatting alone takes up space. Now with my Lollipop update, I still have 2.8 gigs internal space left. Note that I do not install games, just apps like FaceBook,  Twitter and Kindle app.
Also, since 3.0 Android and above, you cannot save any apps to your personal SD card. Instead the apps are installed one way or the other to the INTERNAL SPACE. However, the good thing is that your personal files as photos, music, videos, and more can be installed to your EXTERNAL SD Card so you do have that space for yourself.
**I have a few apps I downloaded from the Playstore, but no games so I still have about 4.3 GB left on my phone for more apps later should I wish to install them.

+ Reading/Creating/Editing Word, Excel, Text Files and much more on this tablet: I downloaded a FREE APP called Kingsoft Office which I use for Office files (it reads, edits and creates Office files). And it also reads PDF eBooks so there is no need to download a separate PDF Reader app. *This is a MUST have if you have to read PDF or Word Docs etc, my docs are crisp and clear using this app.

+ Bluetooth Speed and Performance - The Bluetooth paired quickly with several devices and copied files at a great rate of speed.

+ Cover for this phone - I bought a soft silicone cover for the original Grand phone and it fit this phone OK however, I ordered a TPU cover online for the phone.

CONS:

- Adobe Flash is not supported in this phone or ANY ANDROID DEVICE after 4.0 OS. The only way to get flash is to get a archived flash and use a high end browser such as Puffin or Maxthon Browser. So downloading the older archived flash gives the ability to view SOME internet videos, but this is better than no flash at all. Keep in mind this is a problem with ALL brands of Android devices with 4.0 OS and higher it is just after 4.0 Android came out, the NEW and best flash is NOT supported for Android devices. It is what it is...Also, there is a newer Archived Flash out. So ask me in the comments if you need instructions and I will send them to you.

- Very small instruction ""manual"" provided with the phone, however, I went to the Samsung site and downloaded the full manual and saved it in PDF on my laptop for reading anytime I need it. If you want the link for the manual, let you know in the comments and I will give it to you.

- This phone will NOT accept an OTG (On the go) USB plug for flash drives, mice, etc. This was not a problem for me, I just plug in the USB Cable to copy files to the phone. So no big deal as I use Dropbox to download my photos and files and it is fast and easy.

- This phone is NOT AN INTERNATIONAL PHONE to bring to Europe with you. If you plan on not leaving the United States or just planning traveling to Central America or the Caribbean, then this phone should work out just fine for you. (I am going by what the box for this phone stated as I have not tested this phone anywhere but in the United States).

Bottom line: Would I buy this phone all over again? Yes I certainly would because it is so much better than the first Samsung Galaxy Grand and for me the best phone that I have ever owned! And for the money, I believe this is the best deal out there dollar for dollar. Will this phone be a good choice for you? Yes, as it is a very easy to use phone, will receive Lollipop and for me, this is the BEST SMART PHONE I HAVE EVER USED.
The advertised internal storage is 8gb before the OS andcapps leaving it at about 4.5 gb of so. If you are not into installing lots of games, but want say the FaceBook app. Twitter App, and Kindle App and a few other basic apps, then I recommend this phone to you. If you like lots of games, lots of BIG Apps, then go with a phone like Samsung Galaxy J with 16 gb and 13mp camera and Lollipop etc or a 16gb internal storage phone..

Hope this review has assisted you and thank you for reading it. Please feel free to ask me any questions in the comment area and I will answer all questions in a very timely manner.","5.0 out of 5 stars"

But I soon realized this phone has a lot of kinks. Apps, webpages, or even the pictures folder are slow to open, and sometimes require a phone restart before they work again. This can cause a lot of problems when trying to use the Uber app or quickly snap a pic of a moment. There are some weird bugs like the keyboard appearing or disappearing when it shouldn't. I don't recommend this phone, but I already paid for it, so I guess I'll try to get some mileage out of it before getting a new one. The one great thing about this phone is the battery life (only about 30-40% loss per day). My service carrier is T-mobile.","2.0 out of 5 stars"

It would not update any apps and play store quit working, I contacted Samung USA and the tech recommended a factory reset, which I did as instructed. Now the phone is stuck in a setup loop where I enter the email and password used to setup this phone and it goes back to the same window, requesting the information again. Samsung had me contact Google, who verified the information used was correct and they sent me back to Samsung, who now says they can not help with the phone because it is an international unlocked phone. I would need to contact Samsung in the country the phone came from. Since I purchased it through Amazon I tried to get help from them, but since it has been more then 30 days, they don't care. I contacted the selling company over a week ago, but have heard nothing from them. A phone with a 1 year warranty that you can not get serviced is not a deal at any price. This was a new phone and I would think Amazon would at least try to help resolve this problem. As for the seller, I am not surprised, just expected better from Amazon. If you buy this or any other unlocked international phone, best to think of it as a throw a way phone, because if you have any problems with it, thats what you will end up doing.","1.0 out of 5 stars"

This was Samsung's old model. However, what a great deal this was! This Samsung Android is Unlocked, and has all the functions I needed: Dual SIMM, GPS, Big long lasting battery, excellent APPs and screens, fast, and SD card slot. Works (Unlocked) on Consumer Cellular.  This phone was an Excellent deal for $140...No contract. I have seen and used the S5/S6 models, purchased by others, and they are fantastic phones, but they are not chap. The Samsung Grand Prime DUOS is no ""Punk"" phone however. I am pleasantly surprised. Unlike the newer Samsungs, the Grand Prime only has 8G, but that is OK for us. I installed all Apps to SD card where possible, and stored all pictures, music, documents, and other media (Chess, etc) to SD card. Still have 3 Gig left on the phone. Bought a slim sturdy armor case to protect the phone: MP-Mall [Dual Layer] [Shockproof] Armor Hybrid Defender Anti-Drop Rugged Premium Protective Case Cover.","5.0 out of 5 stars"

You can purchase it from cricket right now for 129.00.  I love this phone!  It is right in my price range (150-200 bucks).  It is still fairly new,  I believe it was released in Nov 2014 and unfortunately it did not come with the 5.0 Lollipop operating system,  it runs off Android 4.4 Kitkat but it navigates and responds quickly.  There have been rumors that it will eventually get a Lollipop update but that is not for certain.  This phone does not have all the bells and whistles of a Samsung Galaxy 5 or 6 but it is still a sharp phone for being under 150.00.  This camera takes pretty sharp and colorful pix with it's 8 megapixel camera and 5 megapixel front facing camera with LED flash and 1080p HD video recording available. You have to go to camera setting to make the camera 8 megapixel as it is pre-set at 6 megapixel out of the box.  The camera is probably the Grand Prime's strong point as it gives you several options and settings you usually would find with a more high end Galaxy phone.  Apps run well on this phone with minimal freezing or crashing and it operates very smoothly!  One reason I can't give the Grand Prime 5 stars is because the internal memory is very small!  It says 8 GB of internal memory but after you activate your phone you only end up with about 4.5 GB of internal memory so make sure you buy an SD card to add to it (up to 64 GB) and move your downloaded apps to your SD card if it allows you to.  Speaker volume is good on this phone but could be a little louder.  Another strong point is the battery.  The battery life of this phone is outstanding!!  Adjusting the power settings makes it last even longer!  Many times I have held a 100% charge for almost 2 hours even after making calls or opening a few apps.  If you are really a fanatic about conserving your battery,  another smart feature of this phone is the 'Ultra power saving mode' that helps your battery achieve the longest life possible. The GPS works flawlessly as well.  For the money I paid,  I love this phone and think it was a smart buy!  However if you are a big tech geek and gadgets type person you might prefer a phone with a bit more features.

*UPDATE*

Cricket fans rejoice!!!  The Android Lollipop 5.1 update is finally being released in the US!  I received mine Dec 1, 2015.  So if you haven't received your's yet it's coming!

PROS

-Sturdy built,  slim design
-Sharp 8 megapixel camera with tons of camera options and settings
-1080p video recording
-As of Dec 2015 most Grand Prime phones should receive the Lollipop 5.1.1 update
-Long lasting battery
-Speaker sound is good

CONS

-Just 8 GB of internal memory (but more like 4.5 GB).  You definitely will need an external SD card with this phone.
-Not a whole lot of fancy features compared to higher end Galaxy phones.","5.0 out of 5 stars"

When scrolling down a page, the phone thinks you clicked on something, and you are then navigated away from the  page you were on. The phone also freezes about twice a month. If you don't plan on searching the internet, then this phone may be for you. Here are a few more cons that are popping up since 1st review. Images stay 8 bit looking before clearing out. Or it just won't clear out at all. Don't plan on zooming in on anything. Responsiveness seems to be getting worse. I kept clicking on a site, and was not taken to the page. Not frozen at the time,  just not cooperating with owner.","3.0 out of 5 stars"
