It puts a customer in control. Carrier unlocked, pure Google Android experience without the annoying bloatware, manufacturer, and carrier  apps. Non-intrusive Motorola features which are extremely helpful but your choice to turn on or off, expandable storage up to 128GB via SDcard, ergonomic design built solid, large vibrant display, front facing stereo speakers with awesome sound quality, and a 21 megapixel camera, if people think it falls short, its only the software and LCD viewing display. Put the picture on a high density 1080p LED display, you'll understand. Pixels matter. Battery life is what it is, not the best but not the worst. Depending on how your going to use the device, it Will always be a matter of contention.
Athough like many have stated, amoled would arguably have been a better choice. Personally, I would liked to have seen the power and volume buttons reversed, but hey, not a deal breaker, you quickly adapt. For the tech savvy, you even have the support by Motorola to unlock the bootloader, although you loose your warranty and rightly so for good reason.
This Moto X Pure is fantastic in so many respects that any shortcomings are far outweighed by its benefits. You can't go wrong!","5.0 out of 5 stars"

BEWARE

Hate how they didn't give us the option to get a smaller version, not everyone wants phablets. But that's not even what I don't like about this phone. First of all the size wasn't that bad, it's about the same size as a G4 and size is decent. But i'd rather have a bit smaller and shorter phone. While the specs seem great about this phone, don't be fooled by reviews online. The front facing speakers were great, def better than the mono speakers most phones come with. Boom speakers from htc are still better but these ones were LOUD but the quality isn't that great but it's still better than mono speakers. Camera is not as good as samsung or lg and a bunch of others but it's def GOOD enough, but great. Overall I liked the camera and especially the Moto Skin, 2nd BEST to stock android. Ok so what I hate is the Quad HD display, quad hd is such a waste, the naked eye can't even tell. So the battery turned out being BELOW AVERAGE....even my htc M8 even lasted just as long and that's 2 years old. What killed this device is the WASTEFUL QUAD HD DISPLAY and the BATTERY and also the size for some people.","2.0 out of 5 stars"

Great phone as well, (best camera of any phone, hands down, no contest with this nor iPhone 6s/Galaxy 6) but Windows Phone was poorly implemented, no SD slot and poor battery performance. This phone is proving to be much more reliable.

The build quality of the phone is outstanding, though the corners can be a bit troublesome to some people, and the huge screen can take a bit getting used to. I have the bamboo back, which I thought was going to be annoying or uncomfortable, but the wood is actually reasonably soft and comfy. To be honest, however, I would have preferred the leather or plastic backs, but the phone is so great that they were out of stock at the time and I chose to secure the phone first.

From opening the box, the phone proves to be a great experience. The inside of the box is very cozy, holding the phone in one slot, and a protective case (though you'd do better buying a rugged case from Amazon instead), power cable, and such in the other. The phone comes with a key thing to open the SIM card/SD card combo slot (it uses a nano SIM card by the way, so if you're upgrading from a micro SIM card phone like the aforementioned Lumia you need a new SIM), which works great. The SIM and SD are a bit meh to insert, but not difficult.

The phone immediately picks up your SIM card and sets up/works great and immediately functions. Absolutely no bloatware or cheap/carrier-specific apps, except for one or two Motorola apps which actually work great for your needs. The specs and screen are both amazing too: the videos look outstanding (Netflix at least. Youtube is really meh) and the colors are accurately reflected. What I love about the phone is the super loud speakers! They don't compromise sound quality over size and the quality is very clear too.

My only gripe with the phone is with Motorola's stock camera app. For 4K videos and the like, it works great. For photos, it's awful. Just awful. Absolutely little to no control over focus, manual controls, and the like. And the macro/focusing interface is among the worst. However, the workaround is really simple: find a different, better camera app. I've tried quite a few, but so far Pixlr is the most consistent, delivering outstanding lighting and image quality and great use of the flash. By the way, unlike most phones, the selfie camera has a flash, so yay I guess?

To summarize, super cool phone and actually preferrable in many regards over Galaxys and iPhones. Just get a different camera app.","5.0 out of 5 stars"

For now, I decided to stick with my Nexus 6 as my daily phone and I have a Moto X 2014 (paid $195 unlocked Best Buy Clearance and bought as a backup). Here are a few topics I found important and I'll explain why I am going to return the Moto X Pure. I also paid $299 during the Motorola sale period. I do think the phone is worth that price for sure if you have an older phone but not as an upgrade over the Nexus 6 or even the Moto X 2014 for that matter.

1) Build Quality.  I don't know exactly what it is, but the Moto X Pure felt more cheaply built than either my Nexus 6 or my Moto X 2014.  It just didn't seem as tightly put together, the bamboo back felt more flimsy than on my bamboo Moto X 2014 and the metal frame felt cheaper too.  The kicker for me was the bamboo was miscut and there was a gap between the finger/camera metal section and the back cover itself.  It seems that the build quality took a hit with the Moto X Pure. If I were to purchase again, I think I would opt for the silicon back. Of the three, maybe because of the smaller size the Moto X 2014 seems the more premium model.

2) Camera - Moto X Pure wins this hands down especially in lower light.  Also the details in photos was much sharper and the phone wasn't searching as much.  It was one of the reasons I wanted to give the Moto X a shot, but it wasn't as big of an improvement as I thought it might be.

3) Screen LCD vs Amoled - Initially, I found myself gravitating more towards the LCD panel.  Having been a previous iPhone user (I prefer stock android) the Moto X Pure did remind me of the iPhone screen quite a bit, but in bright light I didn't notice a huge upgrade from the Nexus 6, which surprised me.  In the evening, when I am reading I do prefer the amoled screen because it does not stay as bright, so I opted to keep my Nexus 6. I think this is a personal preference however.

4) Battery Life - Nexus 6 hands down. I lost about 12-15% more battery running the exact same youtube video on the Moto X Pure than I did on the Nexus 6.  Both were also running Marshmallow. The battery on the Moto X Pure also ran hotter than both the Nexus 6 and the Moto X 2014

5) Feel in Hand - Moto Dimple - I thought this would be an area that the Moto X Pure would easily win, but Motorola decided to LOWER the dimple and make it smaller.  It DOES NOT WORK nearly as well as the dimple on my Moto X 2014 or my Nexus 6.  The lower placement on the dimple of the Moto X Pure makes the phone feel top heavy. It just doesn't feel as natural as the other two.  I have large hands and the Moto X Pure felt thinner than my Nexus 6 of course, but the Nexus 6 felt more comfortable for me because of the higher dimple placement, so I felt like I have more control over the phone. The Pure edition placement does not work for me. I also like the separation between the camera and the dimple.  On the Moto X Pure they are bridged, which made it easier to tell them apart, but again the dimple is too low.

6) Bluetooth Connectivity - Okay the Moto X 2014 wins this one hands down. In fact, I've taken my Moto X 2014 out to exercise quite a bit more lately because it is smaller thus easier to stick in my pocket and forget about it, but it also NEVER cuts out when I have my LG Bluetooth headset on.  I thought my Nexus 6 was bad, but the Moto X Pure cut out constantly. It was the worse of the three.  Not sure what that's all about, but it was horrible.

7) Concluding thoughts - I tried to cover things that were not in Chris W.'s review so hopefully this helps. Now, is the Pure Edition worth the upgrade from the Nexus 6 or Moto X 2014 - personally at $299 it might be from the Moto X 2014, but not from the Nexus 6.  If you have something older it is a good buy, but I would probably opt to pay a bit more for the Nexus 6P (currently $425). At $299 (currently) for both the Moto Pure and the Nexus 5X I would go for the Pure for sure as well.","3.0 out of 5 stars"

After a day of using it, I took a look at my old phone and just couldn't believe how I could be reading from that tiny little screen, so you can get used to it easily.
One thing that matters to me on a phone is the camera: I am not a pro, in fact I do not take many pictures, simply because I like ""enjoying the moment"", but from time to time, while on travel, I want to take a few pictures, and I want them to look good without having to carry a brick like camera. Now, this phone has one of the best cameras I have ever had. Unfortunately, to be honest, iPhone 6 is better on this (my dad owns one and the pics are astounding) but, hey, this is android and half the price after all!
If you are selfie lover (which I am not), you will love the 5 MP front facing camera with flash, for those special moments at the disco.
From a software perspective, Motorola gesture features are awesome. However, do not expect the ""OK Google"" to work: it seems like Google is having some trouble with that at the moment.
It comes with pure Android, latest version. No added look and feels or stupid useless apps like on other brands.
Power charger...how I love this. I forget to charge my devices, period. With this charger, I can get to 25% in about 9 minutes.
A final note on the design: feels great to touch and looks fancy. Although, it might feel too big for your pockets and will catch curious eyes when checking emails or texts, just make sure you are not reading anything private in public.
On the downside, I must admit I was disappointed with what Motorola put in the box: just the power charger and instructions. No USB cable, no headphones (big, big, HUGE MISTAKE). It comes with a bumper case, though (nice touch, but I'd rather have my headphones, what I am supposed to do? buy new ones?! again HUGE MISTAKE).
Overall, I would recommend getting this phone. Great price-quality relationship.","4.0 out of 5 stars"

Shoots 4K video and 21MP still photos with crisp, bright images. The call quality is superb. Very fast with no lag due to a fast processor, no manufacturer's interface and no bloatware.

I have Verizon as my carrier with unlimited data so the built-in tethering and 2.4G/5G Wi-Fi hot spot works fantastic for sharing data with laptops, tablets, etc. while traveling or enjoying the outdoors.

Activating on Verizon was relatively painless, called 611 from another phone and provided the IMEI number and it was operational in 2-3 minutes. FYI, very few if any of the Verizon stores (at least in my area) are corporate owned so the employees are sometimes less than enthusiastic and sometimes lack the knowledge for providing service for products they don't sell.

I purchased mine directly from Motorola before they were available from Amazon so I was able to get the custom accent color, custom engraving and custom boot message. My phone was built in Shenzhen, China on a Thursday and FedEx delivered it on the next Monday.

There are some small differences that enhance the user-friendliness on my part as well as improve things that irked me previously.  Otherwise it is mostly the same as my original Moto X which I am upgrading from.  I'm with Sprint so I didn't get the second generation and somehow I managed to miss another iteration of the Moto X at some point???  Anywho, after eyeing this for months I finally bought it from the Amazon Warehouse...a beautiful white and bamboo 32-GB Moto X Pure.  It was supposedly used but there is no indication of that other than the plastic covering not being over the screen and the paperwork did not have the SIMs card opener---no big deal as I still had the one from my original Moto X.

Thanks to Motorola Migrate, setup was a breeze.  What wasn't a breeze were the idiot Sprint store men who couldn't seem to figure out how to activate my phone.  They finally figured out the right SIMs card to use but not how to make my phone work properly with it.  After wasting a good hour and a half of my time, I finally went to Best Buy where the nice young woman had me going in twenty minutes.  When I asked what she thought their problem was she just shrugged and said she updated the PRL and had no issues getting it on the Sprint network.

That finally aside, I could finally see what it truly had to offer, starting with the camera.  The Iphone's camera is light-years better but that's to be expected with the price point.  Compared to the original Moto X, I am beyond satisfied.  The native camera app still doesn't work as well for me quality-wise so I downloaded a third-party camera and I am presently happy with it.  Other than the camera, that's arguably the only significant difference I see between this and the Iphone.  My husband has the Iphone 6 Plus and when we simultaneously loaded pages and apps, they opened at the same rate of speed (super fast) with no lag.  Even with everything I originally had on my original Moto X that had it filled to the brim at 16 gigs, it is still going strong.  I ordered a 64 GB micro SD to expand the memory just in case but question whether I would need it now.

I am not an electronics guru.  I am simply a person that knows what I like and tends to stick with it.  I've had the original Moto X for 3 years.  I dropped my custom Moto one too many times September 2015 so a new phone was in order.  So I had to hunt down another original Moto X (which I ironically got from Best Buy for $150) which I encased in a sturdy case and kept drop free until now and will pass it on to my daughter.  I couldn't imagine getting another type of phone...Motorola made a believer out of me.  Does this phone have too many additional bells and whistles over the original?  No, not in my opinion but it is still worth it with all of the additional features and improvements and the price point can't be beat.  I love the bigger size...I thought it would be unwieldy but actually it works better for me overall.  The battery...it does charge faster with the turbo charger and lasts all day before I find I need a charge.  I do find that the charge lasts through the night without being plugged which my poor little Moto X original could not boast so that alone is an A+++ in my book.

I apologize if this isn't a very techy review, but like I said, I like what I like and that's that.  My opinion may change depending on whether I run into any issues or not.  I'll update as necessary.","5.0 out of 5 stars"

Currently the phone is running Android 5.1.1, and it's buttery smooth with no performance hiccups whatsoever.  We're about a week or two from getting the Android Marshmallow 6.0 update, which should make the phone perform even better, especially excited about the new battery saving features( DOZE). The battery life on 5.1.1 has actually been really good, as I have no problem getting through a whole day (7am to 10pm) on a full charge. The Turbo charger is also fantastic, I never worry about having to charge the phone overnight anymore. The biggest hold-up I had buying this phone was the size, the thing is big. Surprisingly enough I have gotten use to the size and now prefer the larger size advantages to any disadvantages I may have worried about before. This could probably be considered the best Android smartphone of the year regardless of price if it included a fingerprint sensor, but at $400 with a sd card option, and some waterproofing I'm not sure this can be topped. The only other phones I would have considered would be the Galaxy S5, which is hampered by its truly awful Touchwiz software, and $800+ price point (Samsung could rule the Android world if the boneheads would get rid of Touchwiz and run stock Android, they're hardware kicks ass), and the new Nexus 6P, which looks like an awesome phone, but is $100 more than the Moto X.

Personally, I thought this was going to be a great phone. It started out that way and lasted about 2 months. Then the screen went wacky, vertical lines, very light... After doing some online research it looks like they may have some quality issues with this phone, I can certainly attest to that.
So I call support and the nightmare begins...
Here's the summary of my [really bad word here] experience with support.
I paid $25 to have a working phone sent to me, after which I'm supposed to send my original broken phone back.
Since, I've been sent 3 REFURB replacement phones, ALL NON-WORKING, all have been returned back to Motorola
I'VE BEEN CHARGED OVER $500!!!, which they INSIST cannot be reversed until after they receive my original non-working phone I paid for in full almost 5 months ago now, and I still don't have a working replacement phone. (They tell me one's on the way... They also told me I would not be billed the $500, several times in fact)
This began in January, it's now mid march. Incompetence reigns at Motorola! One cannot assume support staff understands what you say if you're speaking english. After being treated this way, I will do everything I can to NEVER work with Motorola again! I wish I could send this message up the ranks to the person in charge of overseeing support. Either they don't know what's going on, they're completely incompetent, or they just don't care about their customers.","1.0 out of 5 stars"

I like it a fair amount better than my Xperia Z2. In terms of performance, the difference is negligible between the two. This device does have a better screen that's higher resolution and makes Google Cardboard content look a lot better but the Snapdragon 808 is more side-grade rather than upgrade to Snapdragon 801/805 devices. With Marshmallow and Doze, when the phone is stationary, standby time is amazing. There's barely any discharge over night. Also the quick charger is very fast. When moving around a lot during the day, the battery life is mediocre especially compared to Sony phones. It is still good enough for me though. I use my micro-sd as adopted storage and I often forget that I have since the read speeds appear sufficient enough for me not to notice. It's a very nice phone. This will keep me satisfied for a long time.","4.0 out of 5 stars"

After my 2nd Galaxy went belly up after a year I decided it was time to go back to Motorola.  I ordered mine from Motorola.com because I wanted the champagne frame and if I was going to pay the same price as here - I wanted the bambo back engraved. Also for $5 they will send you a SIM card specifically for your carrier - in my case Verizon.  First thing I noticed was how heavy it was in my hand. It feels substantial. The display is amazing - even text is so much clearer than my GS5.  I have only had the phone 4 days so I haven't gotten to play w/ the camera as much as I would like - but I Love Love Love that you shake the phone and the camera opens.  No more having to unlock the phone and open the camera and OOPS - too late.  I also am blown away (again) by the voice response ""Google Now"".  I don't mean to bash Samsung but 50% of the time when I asked it a question it said, ""I will do a Google search for......""  Thanks - I could have done that myself.  I have been having trouble syncing my Outlook calendar w/ my Google calendar and so tonight I ask the Pure - and I'll be damned if it didn't tell me, step by step how to do it.  And it worked.  Amazing.  I love the Daydream Clock display also: It just softly lights up every so often and shows the time and any new messages etc.  Perfect for nighttime.

Setting up the phone was a dream.  I installed the Moto Move application (not the right name - I don't remember now) on my old phone, touched the backs of the phones together and it 'sucked' all the data, contacts, texts, photos, music off my old phone onto the Pure.  Easy Breezy.  I do not back up my texts so I've never been able to bring them over to my next phone.  I was jazzed.  Activating the phone was a bit more challenging - but I think that was User Error. I didn't think to turn the old phone off.....so the new one wouldn't activate.  I ended up calling Verizon (who, of course, gave me the song and dance that because it was an Unlocked phone (read: I didn't but the phone from them) it might not be able to be activated. (yeah right).  Of course as soon as I shut the old phone off, it activated immediately.  My fault, not the phone's.

I also LOVE not having all the Verizon bloatware on the phone.  I ordered the 32G phone and added a 32G card.  I have NEVER had this much empty storage space on a phone.  I can't believe it.  I also love that the speakers are on the front of the phone. Who was the idiot that decide to put the speakers on the back of a phone in the first place?  Really?

The Turbo charge is really nice but not a big deal to me as I work from home...so I always have a charger available. However the battery life is almost twice that of my GS5.  I would charge that phone at night and then always have to charge it again about 1pm or so.  The Pure I usually only have to charge once a day.

The longer I have this phone the more I discover things to love.","5.0 out of 5 stars"

Con,s The biggest one is battery life which sucks but quick charging does help alot,the phone gets hot while Gaming or YouTube but not to bad,moto voice isn't always reliable u have to really yell for it to hear you,and moto actions aren't always reliable.

The thing was rock solid. I dropped it countless times, and still the phone never skipped a beat or the screen crack. Motorola was known to have some of the best radios then, and they do now. So after trying a Samsung phone for a few years (Galaxy S3), this phone came out and seemed like a huge bargain for the specs vs the price. Add in the fact that it can be used on ANY US carrier, and there was no question that I wanted the phone.

I was first hesitant about the size, but let me tell you know, the added screen real estate is great for playing games and reading text. The large battery keeps the phoned powered for 1 1/2 - 2 days with around 5 hours of screen time. I have no doubt that I'll be keeping this phone until it dies on me, which if Motorola's solid builds should me it'll be quite a few years.","5.0 out of 5 stars"

I switched to Android for the first time ever from Iphones. I went android for two main reasons: I use google apps as much as any other app and storage. Apple's prices for stroage are the electronic version of blackmail. I loved the fact I can add up to 128 gig of storage through the external sd card. I really want to love this phone, and there are things I love about it, but I would switch back to iphone today, if I could swing the cost of the 128G iphone right now. First what I love: The storage, the screen (size and clarity) and google which really you can get on the iphone. Now for what I can't live with: Having swithced from iphone I have all kinds of trouble with group texts. I have spent untold hours working on getting this resolved. I have tried every fix know to man. I can be getting group texts in a text string from iphone users and all of a sudden they wont come through and then maybe a day or two later I will start getting them again. With kids in sports and the group text being the only form of communication these days, for this reason alone, I would not switch to android if you have an iphone. They will tell you as long as you sign out of I Message before you switch you will be fine. This is not the case. I have found many other people online who have the same issue. The Bluetooth on this phone is intermittent at best. Some days it will sync with the car, other days it won't. Many times it will sync with the car but will be so full of static it is unusable.  I have a usb cable from the car stereo I can attach, and it won't work at all either with moto x pure. My wife and son have new Galaxies and they work with the usb cable in my car as well as the old iphone. I won't let them try the bluetooth because this phone has been so tempermental I don't want to mess with it. Hands free is a law in my state,s o this is another deal breaker. Besides the fact my phone is my source for music in the car. I'm not loving going back to fm radio. Lastly is the camera. I am sorry but the camera stinks. It is absolutely unusable at night and not great during the day. The other day I imported a photo I had taken with my iphone 5s onto the moto x pure and was blown away by how good it looked on this screen. It looks so good because this phone takes such bad pictures. I am not a photographer and do not need to take particularly great pictures, but I use my camera phone for work every day, and this has been dissapointing. I need to be able to share pictures and the iphone was great at reducing the size to make it easier to share lots of pics. If android can do that, I have not been able to figure it out. I downloaded a couple apps to try to accomplish this with poor results.

I have come to the conclusion the reason the iphone costs so much more than the moto x pure is it is so much better. I should have paid double and stuck with iphone. At this point, I am probably just going to go back to my 5s, the only problem with that is the screen seems so small. Like I said in the begining, I really wanted to love this phone so I could stick it to apple and their rediculous prices for the storage we all need these days. Unfortunately that has not worked out.","2.0 out of 5 stars"

Also, the camera is fantastic in daylight! Pictures are very sharp and look really good. It can be tough to set focus on a minor part of the picture with the Moto camera app, but mostly it isn't an issue.

I thought that the change may not be that bad, so I went with an iPhone to streamline my workflow with my colleagues. The switch was regrettable, and I began hating my switch to Apple. Apple phones are great...but my personal preference just did not appreciate Apple's OS. With all that being said; I researched, and researched, and forum hopped, and researched some more before deciding to go with this phone. I love pure stock Android, and that's what you get with this phone. It's incredibly smooth, fast, responsive, and sleek. The device feels very sturdy in my hand, and the buttons are just the right amount of firmness, adding a very premium feel to the device. The Moto Display feature has been absolutely amazing, and it really is a feature you have to try before you understand how convenient it really is.  I'm an audiophile and I basically have to be listening to music at all times of the day. The speakers on this phone are NO JOKE. They're clear, loud, and the bass is actually there! Mind you...it's still a phone, so don't expect to shake your house with the bass, but it was awesome for listening to tracks and watching media.

Despite this being an ""unlocked"" phone, I had a devil of a time getting it activated by Sprint.  I'm sure many of you will say ""that's a Sprint problem, not a Motorola problem.""  Unfortunately, it BECOMES a Motorola problem when it takes several hours of effort to activate the phone.  Finally, I knew this phone would be bigger than my old Moto X, but I didn't fully realize how much bigger til I received it.  This thing is huge, and not really in a good way.

Its great to see consumers no longer have to pay upwards from $650 to get a phone with these spec's. The only other phone to come close is the Oneplus 2, & it lacks NFC, loud Stereo speakers, more than 2 micro phones & an SD card slot. Not to mention this is the only alternative to a nexus if you're looking for a stock android experience, which all android users should. One of the best features of the phone is its size.

Good value for money. It is on the verge of being too big and it is heavy, so if you have smaller hands think it twice before buying.

Camera performance is good enough and I never find myself longing for a better camera phone anymore.

Performance is good, and compared to a Nexus 5X the biggest difference is having 3GB of RAM instead of 2GB. Android is not very efficient with RAM usage apparently, and it is very annoying when Spotify is kicked out when opening Chrome for example. This does not happen with this phone which is great!

I have dropped it 3 times already with no case on and it has held up nicely, like my previous 3 year old moto G.

Fast charging is very fast!

Downsides:

Battery life is no good, but I guess it is bad on all its competitors as well. On a normal day I unplug it at 8AM and it lasts up until 12PM, so it has approximately 16 hs of battery life with my usage. This includes messaging and email, 1 - 2 hs of spotify while training and using social networks while on my daily commute.

The headphone plug has gotten very sensitive with a couple weeks of use and with the slightest pressure it will think that they are unplugged and will pause the music. My 2013 Moto G developed the same problem but on its second year, not on its second week, so Motorola might be doing something wrong with their headphone plugs.","3.0 out of 5 stars"

I know that's not the easiest thing to check, but you think they would.

The back is curved making the phone thicker in the middle. After coming from a Samsung galaxy s3, which is 4 years old but still works, I felt the screen on the Moto x looked great but colors were a little less vivid but accurate. Even with the saturation turned on it wasn't as colorful but it is super bright. Fingerprints weren't an issue when using the screen since there must be a coating on it. There is no led notification light and notifications appear on the screen with icons or text. I didn't like this feature since its not very private. You can turn off notifications altogether or pick which app can display notifications. Also my biggest problem was to turn on the display after the screen turned off. It kind of turns on when it wants. I'm still not sure if it's rotation or moving the whole phone that turns it on since it works randomly. You could just use the power button on the side but it's awkward with the bumper on. On the old Samsung you can just hit the home button to turn the screen on and the LG phones you double tap but the Moto X has neither. There is an option where it uses a motion sensor to turn on the screen but that seems like it just wastes the battery.The speakers are great since there are two front facing ones that are loud and create a great stereo effect. The battery in not removable and lasts less then a day even without the SIM card installed but the quick charge works great. On stand by the phone has lasted a week. Setup was easy and Moto has an app transferring contacts and apps from your old phone. There  aren't too many options and customizations you can change since its close to being stock android and I found myself installing Nova launcher right away. Even the pull down menu can't be customized and requires either two fingers or two swipes with one finger to see the entire thing. The camera app was awkward to use as you take a pic by tapping the screen anywhere. The camera app is very basic with not many options besides panorama, selfie and normal mode. You can make the picture brighter by rotating this circle in the middle or focus on different things I'm the shot by moving that circle. You can also turn on and off the shutter sound. Pictures taken were good in good lighting and ok in lower light. It's camera is 21mp so you can zoom in and see a lot of detail. Colors are very accurate. There's not much bloatware that comes with it and the phone is snappy. It's already got the marshmallow update too. But I did find a few times I was using the Internet that instead of scrolling when I slid my finger it would select the word instead on the page as if I was holding my finger still. Not sure if that's a display sensitivity issue or software related. Also 4k videos on you tube would keep stopping but the audio would keep playing. It's nice that it's unlocked and works on many carriers and that you can add an sd card to boost memory. Overall for the price it's a great phone with nice speakers and looks but it doesn't have many options to customize or change settings.","4.0 out of 5 stars"

It's not a bad phone, but if you have an issue with it, you are pretty much on your own!","1.0 out of 5 stars"

Without much thought and with little research, I bought it.  I am thrilled.  The 5.7"" screen is significantly easier for me to read than was the Iphone's 5 inch screen.  I can now easily read email and texts without reading glasses. I find myself using phone features that, though similar versions existed on the Iphone, I had never used because they were too hard to read.  For example, I read news articles off the feed that has learned my interests.  My vision is not particularly poor, but I am middle aged and, uh, size matters.  The 5.7"" is perfect.  My hands are average for a man, and I think I'd find a larger phone a bit cumbersome.  This one hits my hand just right.  The processor is so fast that I never think of it; everything pops up instantly.  Battery life is good, and the quick charging feature comes in handy on particularly busy days.  The speakers are so clear and loud that I sometimes listen to music while I shave (I've never done that before with a phone).  I love the simple interface and the absence of bloatware.  I use the simple plastic rim-case that came with the phone, and I purchased 2-year protection directly from Motorola (around 80 bucks, if I remember correctly).  I find it easy to get this phone in and out of my front pockets (my iphone in the otterbox, on the other hand, was hard to move in and out of my pocket).  I added 64GB with an inexpensive sd card that was easy to install.  ;I cannot think of any serious complaint I have.  If I had to make a suggestion, I suppose I'd like to have the power button and volume rocker a bit farther apart -- but that's really picky and it's not really a ""problem.""  This is, by far, the most I've ever loved a phone.","5.0 out of 5 stars"

 I bought this phone to use on Sprint, with the intention of switching to Verizon in a month when my contract with Sprint will be up. I was under the assumption that if you already had a phone with a nano sim card (which this phone requires) you could just put that card into this phone. Sprint won't allow you. Also, none of their stores even had sim cards, so I was required to contact customer service to get one mailed to me. After being transferred 3 times and on the phone for over an hour, they finally told me that it was not possible to activate this phone.
If you buy this phone from Motorola, you can choose to purchase a Sprint sim card. I don't know if it works that way, but its worth a try.

I love Motorola's though. I have a moto x first gen and it still works perfectly. I'm happy with the pure edition, its a nice upgrade without too much extra stuff! Its good size, and doesn't feel uncomfortable in your hand. I was between this and the nexus 5x, and in overall quality, this wins!","4.0 out of 5 stars"

I've read a lot of cons about battery life but It lasts all day for me and then some, perhaps I'm not as heavy a user as others.

The feature I like best is the double twist to open camera, it has worked flawlessly for me every time.
Has a great screen and that's important because I often use the kindle app for reading books, text is clear and sharp.

The camera takes decent pictures, but I don't like the software interface as much as my prior LG G2.

The phone is rather large to stick in your pocket, but it is workable.  I prefer the bigger screen as I need reading glasses now in this stage of my life.

The best thing about this phone is the price for what you are getting it's far less expensive than the latest iphone or even the LG G4 which is a similarly spec'd phone.  This phone even comes with a clear bumper included with the phone which works very well.

The fast charging is very convenient. I bought the 16gb version and a 64gb SD card which gives me plenty of storage for my pictures and music.","5.0 out of 5 stars"

This is the second smartphone that I actually enjoyed ever since the iphone 4(ofcourse there were no other better smartphones in those day). After the iphone4 I bought the iphone 4s for my wife but I know it was also very good smartphone at that time but it did not really enjoy since iOS is so restrictive on what you can do. I also bought the Samsung galaxy S4 for myself and the bloatware was very annoying. I still did not learn my lesson that I bought the Samsung galaxy S6 which I literally slammed it on the floor luckily the floor is carpeted. The Samsung have one of the best cameras out there and they really managed to fail the user experience by adding so much bloatware. I really wanted to slam that as I think of it right now. I think some of us here can relate my frustrations. Until, this Moto X Pure came out. It has a bloatware for sure but it is actually a compliment of what is missing in the OS features. I am referring to the app that Motorola has added ""Moto"". And that is the only bloatware it has and nothing else. A very essential bloatware that I actually enjoy so much using. Sure the camera is not good compared to other smartphones out there but I don't really use it so much even I had the Samsung S6. But software experience is just so enjoyable. And the FRONT FACING SPEAKERS they so amazingly great. Maybe the Nexus 6p is better like they said but if they dont have an app like the ""Moto"" I would rather have the Moto X than the Nexus 6p. They really put so much thought on this phone. Thank you Motorola. I am a happy customer.

LCD screen in lieu of the LED of previous generations. Two fron-facing speakers are great. It has fewer unique functions and features than previous generations. It has decent features for a fairly inexpensive phone. Always on voice activation seems less effective than the first gen...when it works; it often fails in horrible fashion, such as, ""what's up?"" is the phrase to tell you the time and give you the option to hear messages. Usually it results in a google search for ""What's Up?"" or a page showing me what I can do with the phrase ""What's up?"". It's hearing me, it's just not doing what it's supposed to. Especially problematic when driving.
Probably the last Moto I'll buy. Nothing about it sets it apart from anything else, really. Sure it's pretty much stock Android, which is great, but voice search is less effective than the first gen, there's no longer a chrome extension for the device (they recommend searching for a third party chrome app to text online. Lazy asses), and the stock launcher isn't as flexible as say Nova Launcher, which I'm using. Many of the retired  unique Motorola apps are now built-in to Android. Nothing unique. Merely adequate. Which is OK, but a far cry from the creative engineering I expect from Motorola.
 Moto is just a Lenovo brand, not a company, not a subsidiary; it's the yawn-inducing Lenovo now with a batwing logo. I can't imagine the Lenovo culture won't overrun Motorola's. It's a shame. Motorola had made such a great comeback.","3.0 out of 5 stars"

1. Battery life - definitely not the best out there. I usually have to recharge a little at some point because I work long days. The turbo charge ALMOST makes up for this because I usually carry a power brick anyways, but it would be nice to have a battery capacity that I know could make it through a full day of moderate/ heavy use. That is not a big deal though if you always have access to chargers like I do.

2. Camera - This is a very nice camera but I really wish it had OIS. This CAN take beautiful pictures but to get great detail, you have to be pretty still. Also I don't like the default camera app because you cant tap to focus then press a button to take the picture. It's tap to take picture only and sometimes it doesn't focus correctly right away. But, you can always download a different camera app to solve this problem.

Otherwise, I love this phone. It's beautiful, its powerful, and it doesn't break the bank. It almost stock android which is unbelievably smooth if you're coming from carrier phones or phone with an overlapping UI. Motorola puts a few features on it but they are actually super useful and not gimmicky. I would 100% recommend this phone to anyone who needs a phone.

I dropped the 1st Gen and I needed a new phone.
This was logical choice for me.  It has ZERO carrier loaded bloat wear.  I don't have to worry about NFL or Verizon apps.
It is HUGE - and for me this is positive.  I like that I don't have to have a seperate tablet.  Back when I bought the 1st Gen Moto X, I really wished I could have found an unlocked Galaxy Note.  But now, this is the same size as a Note. And about the same size as the Amazon Fire 6"".
I upgraded it to Android 6 the day I got it and it is working smoothly.
Screen is very clear.  Big plus is the MicroSD slot, that is so rare now.  Looking forward to a huge card to add.
edit - Forgot to mention, I just moved my Verizon SIM card over and the new phone worked instantly","5.0 out of 5 stars"

Bought one for for my wife and one for me. Upgraded from a Samsung Galaxy S3 because we wanted a larger screen and a better camera. Processor is so much faster. Pure Android experience has been great. Was difficult to activate phones with Verizon due to Nano SIM card. We had the card but Verizon's database didn't recognize phones. It was as if phones didn't exist. Spent countless hours on phone and online chats with Motorola, Verizon's Customer Service and local Verizon store with no satisfaction. No one mentioned a SIM card adapter until after 2 days of discussion. Went to Walmart and bought the adapter from T-Mobile section and put Nano SIM card in adapter and into Galaxy and called Verizon for them to activate it. Once activation completed, transferred Nano SIM card into Moto X pure edition and all was good. Phone was not the problem. Apps are easy to install and operation is simple. 21 MP Camera - Colors are crisp and my wife has already taken videos and photos of hummingbirds and is very happy with the camera's performance. Two speakers are a plus...sound is awesome. Turbo charge is amazing! Who knew a phone could charge so fast?! Battery was down to 38% and charged fully in 30 minutes. Can't say enough positive things about this phone. Blows Galaxy away! Larger screen is fantastic! Main selling point for me was the phone is unlocked, meaning it can be used with any carrier without having to sign a contract. I didn't want to be under another 2 year contract with Verizon. Prices have become outrageous for phones and data plans. Would recommend this to anyone who wants a faster, more advanced cell phone! A+++

Update! After using this phone for a few weeks we love it even more. It is an awesome phone and we are very happy we made this purchase. You cannot go wrong with this purchase!","5.0 out of 5 stars"

It indeed is a very powerful device compared with their earlier MOTO X releases.

I get it. I did the same thing. Let me ease your stress with a simple list of pros and cons:

Pros:
- excellent LCD display. Accurate colors and very sharp. Very bright also. IPhone 6+ owners tell me this is a nice screen when I hand it to them.
- excellent performance. Snappy and rock stable, just like every moto x. Go to developer options and set animations to .5 for an even snappier feeling experience.
- solid battery life. I'm typing this at 10 pm after a full day of use. My battery just hit 15% with over 4 hours of screen on time, half an hour of calls. It will get you through the day.
- solid camera. Takes excellent photos. Comparable if not better than gs6 in good lighting. Colors are extremely accurate. Suffers in very low light, but performs well in all other scenarios.
- moto reliability. Everything on this phone works well with few compromises and almost zero bugs. The same can't be said for the gs6, note 5 or g4. Excellent signal reception on Verizon as well.
- unlocked. Seriously! This is one of the first phones to support all major US networks. It's a surreal experience using a phone with no branding on Verizon.
- audio quality. The speakers on this thing are awesome. Loud and they sound great. Headphone audio is also excellent.

Cons:
- almost too big for me. Accidental touches on the sides of the display during one handed use are common for me. I'm adjusting, and your opinion may be different when it comes to big phones. It's small for a big phone, but still big nonetheless.
- vibration motor is a bit weedy. Doesn't get up to speed enough for solid keyboard feedback. It makes the phone feel slightly less premium to me.
- slippery metal. It was the same on the 2014 moto x. When my hands are dry, this thing is very slippery. Tpu case is coming!

Let me be clear on this one: I would get this phone even if it cost $650. I've always loved moto, and their software experience trumps even Google's nexus phones. This isn't a mid range device or a cheap flagship; It's a flagship. Period. Get this phone. You won't regret it.

A little background about me: I sell phones for a Verizon retailer. I see the s6, note 5 and g4 (and iPhones) on a daily basis and compare them with this phone frequently. I owned an s6 for several months, before that I had both 1st and 2nd gen moto x.","5.0 out of 5 stars"

1.  I know it is a stock Android issue but a restart option would be nice.  Right now you can only shut down and manually restart.

2.  Even though it is an unlocked phone they still lock you out of using the phone as a Hot Spot.  I had been using an unlocked  Asus Zenfone 2 with Lollipop and the Wi Fi worked without issue.  On this phone I get a message to see my carrier.  If I am buying the phone the burden of dealing with the Wi Fi hotspot needs to be handled by the carrier, not by the phone manufacturer.  I shouldn't have to load a mod to use the phone's functionality. Italy felt it necessary to support Germany and it ended poorly for everyone.  Just because Motorola is a big corporation doesn't mean it has to lick the boots of other large corporations.","4.0 out of 5 stars"

When connected to wifi, you will not be able to receive calls and text messages. Calls will go directly to voicemail, and messages will never be received. Once I turned off wifi, I received the missing messages. This does not happen with GSM carriers as I also tested this with Cricket, and did not experience the problem.
I spoke with Sprint support, and they confirmed this to be a phone issue with the Pure. I previously had a Sprint branded phone, and this never happened (we even tested it again by removing the Pure from my Sprint account and re-activating my old phone). In addition, this phone would not even accept Sprints attempt to update my cellular network settings.
I then called Motorola, and their support was useless. They stressed there was nothing wrong with the phone, and the issue was attributed to my wifi signal interfering with my connection. Their solution was to change the signal channel on my router? When I mentioned this also happens at my job when connected to wifi, they suggested I contact my network team and have them change the wifi channel- seriously????
Because of Motorola's not taking responsibility for this issue, I will be returning this phone. In this age of data caps, a number of people utilize wifi, but I cannot be put in a situation where someone attempts to call or message me, and them not getting through.","2.0 out of 5 stars"

I like the screen, which is large bright and appears to have good color accuracy. The phone seems to have a very short battery life, perhaps12-14 hours, but if I have a busy day, odds are good the phone is down to 15% by dinner. The battery takes a *VERY* long time (8+ hours) to charge unless you use a qualcomm quick-charger, which they provided (I forgot mine in a hotel). Most of my chargers are 2 amp models for iphones, which I guess Android phones do not use.

Motorola's software is okay, their camera app seems superior to google's own. The camera itself has lots of pixels, but without good light the images are weak. Also, the camera tries to apply a lot of color correction (white balance) without giving a user a choice (the camera will push sodium (yellow-orange) lights in fog until the whole image is grey).","3.0 out of 5 stars"

Basically, this phone covers all the basics that I need: (Almost) stock Android, official Marshmallow update already released, gorgeous big screen, capable camera, and SD memory expansion. The fact that it's carrier neutral, unlocked and still fully-compatible with Verizon (CDMA & LTE) is just icing on the cake.

This phone is big, but not too large for my medium-sized hands. Still, I'd recommend against using a bulky case. Good thing there's an included bumper but I'm using a clear TPU case. I installed the Marshmallow update before restoring my apps & data from Google backup--everything restored fine (including homescreen layout--coming from a GPE device.) This phone really flies--minimal lag even with dozens of apps cluttering my Recents menu.  Camera quality is excellent unless in really low lighting. The quick charger is indispensable--I've gone from near zero to 50% in roughly 20 minutes. Battery life on the whole is pretty decent--Marshmallow doze mode helps when the phone is just sitting idle, but I suppose
other big phones (Note 4/5, iPhone 6S Plus) may get more usage between charges.

Overall, this meets or exceeds what's expected for a flagship phone in 2015, and is a better value than buying anything else on a 2 year contract.","5.0 out of 5 stars"

There are two complaints I do have on this phone. One is that the battery is not the greatest although Motorola's Turbo Charging does make up for this. The second is that the phone does get warm every now and then through heavy use. Other than that, I can't complain on anything else. For one, this is a Pure, Stock Android phone running 5.1.1 Lollipop out of the box with Moto apps on top of it. This phone is unlocked and even capable of running on Verizon. I don't know why it was difficult for some people to activate this phone on Verizon but mine activated on it's first try, guess I got lucky. This phone also rocks a 5.7 QHD IPS display which is probably why battery life isn't the best since most of the power goes towards that screen. It also has expandable memory so I was able to load all of my music, pictures, and videos with ease. The Moto X is aesthetically pleasing with the wood back and metal frame. Although the phone is not the thinnest on the market, the curved edge makes it easy to hold. The 21 Megapixel camera is a lot better than the previous Moto X but the clarity could be better. Low light shots is where the camera takes its biggest fall. The phone is somewhat water resistant too so it could take splashes here and there but it is not submersible. It not right to call this a budget phone, but more of a value phone because of the Awesome specs you get with the price. If you're looking for an unlocked phone with amazing stock android experience, you have to give this a shot.","4.0 out of 5 stars"

The screen is large, but the phone is designed so well that it doesn't feel like a massive phablet, unlike the competition.  It has some pretty impressive hardware specs and you can certainly tell, the phone is always responsive and never shows any signs of sluggishness.  The phone is thin, but feels heavy which I like.  The curved body really makes it comfortable to hold, and the dimple on the back is perfectly placed for your index finger.  Battery life is surprisingly well for a phone this size, and the turbo charging feature is second to none.
I'm very happy I chose to stay with the Motorola brand.","5.0 out of 5 stars"

Can switch to a new carrier very easy even if they use different network technology (ATT vs Verizon).  The only weak areas are battery life (charges fast though), camera is average, touch screen is not sensitive enough sometimes.  All in all a great phone for the price.","5.0 out of 5 stars"

I have always been a bit of a purist when it comes to the android experience, and so I've never strayed far from the Nexus line. While the Nexus 6p is pretty impressive this year, I ultimately decided against it for the same reason that many people will buy it -- the AMOLED display.

AMOLED technology is beautiful and has some of the most vibrant colors that you can get. However, screen burn-in is still an inevitability of the technology. I thought I could live with it when I got my Nexus 6 (2014), but in the end I was very unhappy. If you read a lot on your phone or do anything where images will be on the screen for any length of time, burn-in will eventually find you. In my case, it was really bad and distracting to my everyday use.

So this year I decided that I was back to LCD if I could possibly find something that caught my eye. Enter the Moto X Pure!

While AMOLED is quite beautiful, I don't feel like I've sacrificed anything with this screen. It is gorgeous and very vibrant. The phone itself is a bit thicker than most flagships, but the curved back is pleasant to hold in my hand. I originally wanted a customized phone from Moto Maker, but I ultimately went with the plain white from Amazon to save money. It's still really pretty!

I'm very much pro-phablet, but the 6 inches of my Nexus 6 was just too much. I do have small hands, so your mileage may vary here, but the Pure feels so much better in my hands. I don't miss the extra screen realestate as I feel like I can actually hold my phone now without being constantly in danger of dropping it.

As for speed and UI, the Pure is pretty much stock android with a few neat little Motorola features that can be turned off if you don't want them. I haven't been able to trigger any lag yet and the performance seems great on every front that I've tested.

This is probably the happiest I've ever been with a phone and I'd definitely recommend it wholeheartedly to anyone in the market.","5.0 out of 5 stars"

I opted to buy off amazon over the moto website. The website gives you the ability to build and customize to your liking, which I wanted soo bad. But when it came down to it, amazon didn't charge me an arm and a leg for shipping, I saved ~80$ going through amazon over Motorola, which meant I jumped up to large memory. The savings was in the taxes and shipping. I was initially going to get 16gb internal memory, however, for 20$ more than what I would have paid for 16gb through Motorola, I got 32gb from amazon.

I have only had the Moto X Pure Edition for one week, and I'm already in love. The good things: It's blazing fast, no lag whatsoever, it runs smoothly. The camera is great, takes good pictures. The bad thing: I would go for the battery. It doesn't last that long if you are using it to watch videos or reproduce music a lot. With a ""normal"" usage, like browsing, chatting, it lives a lot more, maybe like 12 or more hours. But it compensates with the turbo charger. It's really amazing, like literally turbo. I give it 5 stars because I love it, the design is beatiful, it doesn't feel *that* big once you are used to it, and the minor complaint of battery life doesn't matter that much because it charges amazingly fast.","5.0 out of 5 stars"

It was something of an impulse purchase for me.  My son's phone died.  I'd been contemplating the upgrade because I loved the idea of the open-ness and carrier independence of the phone.  So this would just be perfect, since he could inherit my old Galaxy S3 (yeah, what a dad, right?  Kudos to Samsung and Sprint I just got an update a month ago for it).  This is definitely a nice phone.  As you can tell from the S3 I like to keep my phones a while, and this looked like a phone I could live with for the long haul.

I use Ting, which can carry on either Sprint or T-Mobile.  Sprint coverage is better in my area, so I ordered the correct CDMA SIM card and this phone.  Going GSM is reported to work fine also.  At first it was a little odd having such a big phone, but I've grown accustomed to it over the last few weeks.  I installed Moto Migrate on the S3, and, after getting the included version of said app updated on the Pure, it was just a matter of touch and go (before the upgrade they couldn't maintain a WiFi connection).  Easy peasey.

Signal strength is better than the old S3.  Battery life is MUCH better.  I work in what seems like a Faraday cage for cell signal (regardless of carrier), and all the searching for signal would drain the S3 in a work day if I didn't keep it charged throughout the day (yet the phone could last all weekend at home).  No charging and the Pure ends the work day around 85%, despite weak signal.  The screen is crisp and clear.  There's a little more glare than I'd like - maybe a screen shield (on the way) will help.  My eyes are old enough that the jump to qHD isn't such a bit thing; though a little extra screen real estate is.  The Moto software is fine, though I really do wish this thing had a notification LED.  I knew I'd miss that, maybe not as much as I was expecting and maybe I'll get over it.

The phone definitely feels solid, though the (I got the plain ol' black) back seems a little slick.  The included bumper cover broke pretty quickly and I have a case on the way for some protection.  Yeah that cover was pretty much useless.  I mean, it was nice of them to include it I guess but it cracked quickly right around the button holes where there's little meat to it.  Other than that you only get the phone and a (turbo) charger, plus a little tool to eject the SIM/uSD carrier.  Not even earbuds or a data cable, sheesh.  I've not seen the battery below say 30% or so.  The charging is quite fast, but probably I've not let it get low enough to really show off what turbo charging can do.

Otherwise everything about the phone itself seems solid.  It's always responsive, largely junk-free, and easy on the eyes.  Great coverage and sound.  WiFi and BT have likewise been solid as a rock.  Pictures have been few but what it has taken has been sharp and accurate.  Yes I miss the notification LED, and I wish the battery were replaceable (though that would probably hurt water resistance).  Hard to have it all but at this price it's great.  Still waiting to see how Motorola is on updates.

About the day after ordering this I found out about the Nexus 5X and 6P being released, and the Google Fi service (that would be great for me).  The 5X in particular looked interesting, but the lack of uSD slot is a hard pill to swallow.  I had a little remorse at first but I think this is a better deal than those.  I just hope that Google Fi will soon allow BYOD with the MXP, as it's one of the few phones that can do it no problem.","5.0 out of 5 stars"
"","","Great Phone but with one defect that I have encountered.  The sim card door is difficult to open and in fact I have already damaged/ruined it trying to remove it. You stick in the little pin that comes with the phone and the door is supposed to pop open.  It is very flimsy and delicate.  Opening the sim card door should be a no brainer.  What am I doing wrong?","5.0 out of 5 stars"

I took it out of the box, was in the middle of the setup process, when the phone randomly changed my pin and locked me out. furthermore, the reset process found in the user guide doesn't work. I'm glad this happened before I went through the trouble of switching everything out from my iPhone.

TWO WEEKS LATER

After writing this review, I called Motorola customer service. For a company that claims to care about its customers, they sure aren't friendly to those with disabilities. The first representative hung up on me when I said that I was blind. The second person, after being told multiple times that I was blind, couldn't see the screen and needed some guidance through the reset process, kept asking me if I saw the menu with the reset option. After 30 minutes of this, he transferred me to yet another service person who claimed he couldn't help me because I couldn't read him the serial number on the box. Furthermore, he implied that I had stolen the phone, and that's why I couldn't give him the number.
I ended up finding some correct instructions online, was able to set up the phone and am using it. It is a good device, but the horrible customer service and the fact that it put me in the position described above keep me from giving it the highest rating.","1.0 out of 5 stars"

This is a really fragile phone, however, so I suggest you put it in a case as soon as possible. I usually prefer to not use cases, but I really think its necessary here unless you've got the insurance (or disposable income) to replace the phone when the screen shatters. The metal frames around the phone also make it feel ""premium"" yet slippery in the hand. I dropped my phone while doing the camera gesture (which I've since turned off) and my Moto X now has permanent dents and scuffs around said metal frame.

Most of the software additions seem rather pointless to me, but I tend to be someone that prefers a pure Google experience, so I just turned off all the features I didn't need. The camera gesture, which is the one where you shake your phone to open the camera app, is useful enough, however, don't do it too vigorously like I did. I don't use Moto Display since this screen is LCD rather than Amoled, so I'd rather save battery life than to see my notifications easier (and, I also have an Android Wear watch that does everything Moto Display does, only much better). Moto Assist is pretty decent. I like how it detects when I'm driving and reads my text messages for me. Moto Voice is also alright. I like how I can change the ""Okay Google"" phrase to anything I want (I used ""Hello Computer"" from Star Trek V).

TLDR; Phone has stock Android and microSD card slot, Motorola software is alright but not that useful, phone is slippery, put a case on it unless you can afford to replace a shattered device.","4.0 out of 5 stars"

It's not the fastest, Smartest or easiest to use but I was happy with it.. Until it fell off my couch on the carpet and the screen exploded.

Okay, so let's get started.

The design of the device is just simply beautiful and it feels fantastic in the hand. The aluminum rim and the varying options of back styles, as well as the camera and accents works really well to give the phone a sleek yet sturdy form. The metal rim surrounding the edge of the phone feels like just the right amount of metal for the device. There are plenty of other alternatives in which overkill the aluminum ideal (HTC, iPhone and the Nexus 6P), but Moto X just uses it to emphasize. The nice curvature of the back definitely make it easier to hold and maneuver during use. It took a little time to get used to the peculiar camera design, however it does give a sense of personality to the latest Moto phones.
One of the features that I love the most about this phone is the support for additional storage, via microSD. If you buy a higher quality microSD card, then it's major bonus to storage. In Android 6.0, the microSD can be formatted to be recognised as additional internal storage if you desire so. It is very difficult these days to find a phone in which supports the use of microSD, so I'm more than glad that Motorola decided to go this route. I personally got my hands on a 16GB model, which on normal terms would be irrational, but in this case definitely worth it. I highly recommend a microSD card with read speeds of 80Mbps or higher, but my older SanDisk microSD worked as well.
I find the 5.7” display to be crisp and vibrant, having 1440x2560 pixels with a 520 ppi pixel density. No, it's not extremely saturated or rich in contrast to the extent that AMOLED displays generally are, but that's okay. Personally I find AMOLED to be a bit overrated. They're usually way oversaturated (even when toned down to be more natural) making them feel unrealistic, plus they tend to get burn-in very easy. I am the type of person who notices burn-in right away, so that's an extreme downside for me. I'm fully satisfied with the fact that Motorola has decided to drop the AMOLED idea, in favor of IPS LCD instead. That's pretty much the main reasons why I stopped going with Samsung and earlier versions of the Moto X. I, for the time being, refuse to use any devices sporting AMOLED technology until there is somehow an improvement with the lifespan.

You can definitely say I'm not an audiophile, but these dual front facing stereo speakers found on the Moto X Pure are very nice. Probably the best that I've had thus far on a phone, given the balance in sound. They get very loud as well. Not many high end phones on the market provide dual speakers on the front, especially of this quality. It's a huge plus for when listening to music or playing video straight from the device. Normally I'd be grabbing for my headphones to provide better sound and audio immersion while watching YouTube or Netflix, but now I prefer doing so without. Since having experienced speakers like this, I can't see myself turning back toward previous ways of smartphone audio.

When it comes to the camera on a smartphone, it's best to take the MP count with a grain of salt. However, the Moto X Pure sports a 21MP (f/2.0, 27mm, phase detection autofocus, dual-LED dual tone flash) rear shooter and a 5MP (f/2.0, 1.4 µm pixel size, LED flash, 1080p at 30fps) front facing shooter. There are of course times where I miss a shot, but it's far from frequent. Two flicks of the wrist and it's open and ready to go in which makes accessing it so easy. I can't really say that I'm disappointed with the lack of laser autofocus in which you find in other devices like the OnePlus 2 and both the Nexus 5X and 6P, because I prefer to manually select where I want to focus the image to be captured. The shots I take usually turn out very good, being they're very sharp and close in accurate color saturation, contrast and exposure. Most shots have quite a bit of depth where older cameras and smartphones failed. This in turn makes life a lot easier and gives more to work with when using my favorite app, Snapseed.

The battery life on the Moto X Pure is relatively decent. It's nothing spectacular and to be honest there is no real improvement when comparing to past generations of smartphones despite being a 3000mAh battery. That is by no means awful, but it's just simply not that awesome. Yes it is possible to stretch it for a full day and possibly a little more with the settings adjusted right. However, it would be nice to see a bit more. The fast charging is just downright incredible and quite the lifesaver in certain times of need. It really improves the dynamics of the battery life throughout daily use, in giving the ability to quickly refresh in between times of busyness. Usually at work or at school, the likelihood is that you won't be using the phone that heavily and with Marshmallow (Android 6.0) it should last just fine. Quickly topping off usually means you don't need to worry about a dying battery before the day is done, so when given the chance to do so it's definitely nothing to stress over. Say, if you have plans for the evening after a long day and have already consumed a considerable chunk of the battery so far, you could always charge up right after in the time it takes you to get freshened up. It's a workaround compared to having a massive battery crammed inside, but a very useful one at that. The only concern I have is how warm the back gets whilst charging especially with medium to heavy usage. Most of the time I leave it in front of the fan to ensure it stays cool whilst charging, but that might not be suitable for all.
In comparison to the other options available at this time, the processing package in the Moto X Pure definitely keeps the phone working smoothly and fast. Of course, on occasion there's a little bit of stutter (could be due to software), but overall the phone is definitely sharp and fast. The use of the Qualcomm MSM8992 Snapdragon 808 processor (dual-core 1.8 GHz Cortex-A57 and quad-core 1.44 GHz Cortex-A53 CPU and Adreno 418 GPU) accompanied by 3GB of DDR3 RAM appears to be playing it safe on Motorola's end, but I definitely don't believe that's a bad thing. It ensured that the phone would do exactly as was needed with a lesser likelihood of future problems (overheating or malfunctioning). Keep in mind, Motorola is usually skillful with software/hardware optimization. Obviously at the time of release, the Snapdragon 810 processor was quite the risk regardless of how strong and secure it as proved to be with the Snapdragon 810 v2.1. As far as I can tell, the Snapdragon 808 processor provides a decent battery life through power efficiency, yet the strength to execute the demands you throw it at it.
One of the largest concerns when it came to the Moto X Pure was whether or not it would get timely updates. For a while before Lenovo took over Motorola, the Moto phones had received updates the fastest out of all OEMs, bested only buy the Nexus lines. However, it seems as though Motorola has kept true to their word and the latest version of Android had a relatively quick release to the Moto X Pure. That may or may not be true for other Moto devices, such as the Moto G phones and previous versions of the Moto X, but at least it's true for this one. Marshmallow seems to be running fantastic so far, at least I haven't had any issues personally. Of course it will never compete with Nexus (in which I normally love), but it's tagging along very closely behind. Hopefully Motorola keep this up for the future.
With all that said, there are two features that I do wish were included in the design of this phone. It would have been nice if there was a fingerprint scanner in the beloved Moto dimple (I love that Moto dimple), and it would have been nice if the Moto X used USB Type-C which is more “future proof”. To be honest I'm not really sure if that is even a possibility, but it would have been very appreciated to say the least. I'm hoping that the next generation of Moto X continues with the very functional formula used so far, but also includes these two features as well.","5.0 out of 5 stars"

It was a great phone for me for well over 3 years, but it was finally time to get a new phone. That's my set-up to where I was at when I researched my purchase. Next I'll share the requirements that I was looking for so you can better understand why I rated this devise at 5 stars.

Now, for my requirements:
1. SCREEN SIZE. My shift from the iPhone was based on my realization that I really needed a portable ""Internet device"" with a phone feature, rather than a phone that has Internet capacities. The increased display size from the iPhone 4 (3.5-inch diagonal) to the 5.5 inches was a game-changer! So, no ""small"" smartphone for me. This means that only the larger phones were of interest to me and that the new iPhone SE was not an option. This leads me to my next requirement.
  >>MOTO X PURE EDITION. 5.7"" Quad HD display with 2,560 x 1,440 resolution. Very impressive.
2. PRICE. I've moved over to a month-by-month carrier (Cricket) and saving serious money each month. The downside is that I'll be paying for a phone up front. So, I set my price point at $400. I really didn't want to pay more than that for a phone. I couldn't see paying almost $1000 for a phone...if I paid that much I should be getting a laptop!
  >>MOTO X PURE EDITION. The phone lists at $399, and this was clearly in the ballpark, but can be adjusted up or down based on the onboard memory.
3. CAMERA. The camera on my Note 2 was excellent for its time. It was 8 MP at f/2.6. I was able to publish shots from the camera both on the Internet as well as on print material.
  >>MOTO X PURE EDITION. This one is almost overkill, it has a 21 MP camera and a f/2.0 lens! The software is impressive too! This is a 10/10 for me.
4. BATTERY LIFE. The removable battery on the Note 2 was a real benefit for me when I purchased it. Getting new batteries and changing them on the fly was seen as a benefit. However, since I rarely replaced batteries on my Note 2 and found the process of changing an internal battery quite simple, the changeable batteries are a nice feature rather than a needed one.
  >>MOTO X PURE EDITION. After 1 week of use, it has an excellent (non-removable) battery--all day and still power to last another 8-10 hours of my typical use.
5. LOOK. I like when phones look good. Why make an ugly phone? I'm not sure.
  >>MOTO X PURE EDITION. It looks amazing. I have the real bamboo back that looks stunning against the metal sides.
6. PROCESSOR SPEED. I don't do gaming so I'm not too worried about this, but I don't want the delay when I'm moving from app to app and opening photos and video.
  MOTO X PURE EDITION. With the Qualcomm hexa-core Snapdragon 808 with 3GB of RAM this phone is quick and snappy. Very impressive (but then again, I'm not gaming either).
7. MICRO SD SLOT. I'd rather pay for an inexpensive micro-SD card than pay the big $ up front for more onboard memory. While it's true the additional onboard memory is better, everything comes at a cost.
  MOTO X PURE EDITION. This device will take up to a 128GB micro-SD card. Sweet!

In addition, there are some features that I liked and/or was surprised about, but that were not on my ""must have"" list:
- Quick Charging. It has, what they call, Turbo charge. It charges amazingly fast. While I've not tested their claims that a 15 minute charge will give 10 hours of use, I don't doubt it. Very impressive.
- Front Speakers. The volume and quality of sound are very strong. Speakerphone is good and music is wonderful for a device that small. These are the best I've heard on any smartphone.
- Video Quality.
- Minimal Bloatware. This phone doesn't have the clutter from a bunch of preloaded apps from Motorola. It's a sweet, crisp Android installation.
- Water Repellent. I don't plan to go swimming with the phone, but over the years, my phones have had their share of battles with water. This is a nice feature that can't hurt!
- Hands Free Response. The phone does a great job of responding to my voice. It's easy to make a quick call or text and not even touch the phone. This is very sweet.
- Front Camera Flash. I've not used it, but a nice feature to use with the wide-angle, 5-megapixel selfie camera.

Downsides:
- It's not an iPhone. Well, for some, that's an upside. But for me, I would love the ability to connect seamlessly with my Apple laptop. The problem is, I'm not willing to pay over $800 for a nicely-sized, nicely-equipped Apple cell phone!

Maybe I'll learn more later, but right now...it's a pretty impressive phone based on my first week of use. Of course, my rating of 5 stars may not be the same as others, but I've tried to be open about why I rated as I did. I hope this is helpful to someone else.","5.0 out of 5 stars"

The phone's power button quit working 3 months after buying the product and the ""warranty"" that is provided with this phone is a complete scam. Even after admitting that the phone was defective through no fault of my own, Motorola still skirted around the issue of providing a replacement product. After a lengthy argument, they finally told me that I would have to pay them $25 to have a replacement shipped to me and that was take it or leave it. I paid for a warranty to avoid this. This is my 2nd Motorola phone to own, and while I thank God that I never needed the warranty on my first one, this will be my last Motorola product.

EDIT: They promised to supply a replacement device to me within 5-6 business days from my request. 8 Business days after I ordered the replacement, I called back and they advised me that the phone had not shipped yet due to being out of stock, but they guaranteed that it would ship within two additional business days. 3 Business days later, I called back and they told me that I should expect my replacement in perhaps up to 2 weeks, as they can't seem to locate a single replacement.

Mostly due to my being with Verizon, and their stupid CDMA network. Granted the 4G is great but the CDMA limited my phone selection, no cheaper phones like the One+ One or any of the other solid cheap phones that are all GSM only. That all changed with the introduction of the Moto X Pure Edition, as soon as I found out I could finally get a nice phone without all the stupid Verizon bloatware I was sold. If it weren't for the Moto X I likely would have switched from Verizon, I was so fed up with overpaying for phones that would work on the network. I was spending more on used phones than I did for the Moto X.

The phone itself has been nothing but great, I have had a huge variety of phones over the years, ranging from, iPhones to Android phones from many manufacturers including, HTC, LG, Sony, and Samsung. They all offer their own spin on Android, some were ok and others like the samsung touch wiz drove me crazy. I was excited to get nearly stock android with the Moto X and the Motorola touches only add to the experience. Simple things like the notifications from the lock screen is awesome and now that I have it I couldn't live without it.
Another thing that Verizon hampers when it comes to their phones is the OS updates for Android. I am excited to know that my phone will actually receive updates rather than just talk of potential updates at some point in the future.

So the bottom line is simple if you are looking for a great phone at a great price then look no further than the Moto X Pure Edition.

This phone rocks

Verizon service is great but some of their policies and practices are horrible luckily the Moto X broke the mold and now it seems that the new Nexus phones will follow suit and offer Verizon compatibility. If good phones keep coming at these price points then I may well stick with Verizon for good.","5.0 out of 5 stars"

They both have the same issue that when trying to talk on the phone, it starts a popping sound the the earpiece to the point I cannot understand what is said. They gave me a refund on the first one. Like a fool, I bought a second because it was on sale. Same issue. Well, I like all the other features so let's see if they can repair it. Nope. I ask for a refund. Nope. I have exhausted their 14 day return period. It doesn't matter part of that 14 day was while the phone was being sent back for repair. Now they are going to send me a third one and they say they will make sure it works right. How? The popping noise doesn't happen all the time. Well, I guess I will just have to hope it does better. And in the meantime, I will be contacting my credit card company to see if they will be able to get me a refund. I really do not want another phone by Motorola.","1.0 out of 5 stars"

I've used the Note 4 for most of the past year, and the 6Plus for over 4 months. Both have great features, great screens, but both are clearly overpriced for what they offer.

Here's a quick comparison between those two and the new Moto X Pure:

Screen:
Note 4 - average brightness, intense colors, sharp, over saturated, great viewing angles, deep blacks, but with terribly yellowed whites. Considered the 2nd best screen on the planet after the Note 5. But I greatly dislike it. Colors aren't real, reading black text against yellow white isn't pleasant. 518PPI.
iPhone 6 Plus - bright, clean, sharp, well balanced, great viewing angles, not so good blacks, TRUE whites. 441PPI. (BEST FOR ME)
Moto X Pure - bright, clean, sharp, well balanced, worst viewing angles, not so good blacks, less yellow than Note 4, but not as white as iPhone. 520 PPI. Aside from the viewing angles (not important for how we actually use a phone - by looking straight at it), it is a terrific screen.

Body:
Note 4 - ugly, fake leather, sharp edges, scratch magnet on the edges, capacitive buttons, protruding camera breaks EASILY, easy to  hold, body to screen ratio is good, perfect thickness. Ugly home button.
iPhone 6 Plus - ugly body, TOO THIN - doesn't feel substantial, slippery, protruding camera, large bezels on top and bottom, extra large phone for a smaller screen. Ugly home button.
Moto X Pure Edition - excellent screen to body ratio, easy to hold, a bit on the thicker side but it actually feels nice. On and volume buttons perfectly placed. No home button as the phone KNOWS when you approach it or pick it up to use it.

Battery:
Note 4 - 10-15 hours + extra battery - BEST
iPhone 6 Plus - 10-15 hours
Moto X Pure Edition - 6-10 hours

Operating System:
Note 4 - TouchWiz Android - Slow, laggy, obtrusive, filled with useless features, only gets worse the more you use the phone. Slow updates or NO updates from Samsung or Carrier. Terrible Support.
iPhone 6 Plus - iOS - Fast, responsive, always up to date, no lag, no slow downs, clean interface, unbeatable support! Great features by apple software.
Moto X Pure Edition - Pure Android - FAST, RESPONSIVE, always up to date, NO LAG, no slow downs, no slow down due to extended usage based on older models, support by Motorola isn't the best based on other reviews; if you buy it from best buy or Amazon and insure the device through them, it should be better. Great, useful features by Motorola Software.

Features:
Note 4 - Pen is phenomenal and works as advertised. Camera is one of the BEST in a smartphone, but it's slow to launch, sometimes taking up to 10 seconds, and you can't review the photo you just took because opening gallery will usually FREEZE the whole phone. Happens often enough! No manual controls. Remote control feature is great. MicroSD. Fast charging. NFC. Low volume output through the earphones.
iPhone 6 Plus - excellent camera. FAST, FAST, responsive, always there when you need it. No manual controls. Very slow charging. Excellent volume output and sound quality via headphones.
Moto X Pure Edition - excellent camera, FAST, responsive, can be launched FAST by twitching your arm twice. MicroSD. Fastest charging available. Excellent volume output and sound quality via headphones.

Overall:
Note 4 - SAY NO to Samsung. Until they make a phone with a decent, fast, reliable OS, don't buy it. It kills the experience. TOO EXPENSIVE.
iPhone 6 Plus - excellent phone. It does everything WELL. It is always responsive and reliable. TOO EXPENSIVE.

Moto X Pure Edition - Excellent phone. It does everything WELL. FANTASTIC Price. Right now, there's nothing that beats this phone for its price. Excellent screen, design, great camera, fantastic OS and software. I see no reason to ever pay over $400 for a phone again.","5.0 out of 5 stars"

For me, however, there was a LOT lacking to the interface because it's nothing more than the base Android software. I wanted to really like it, especially since I bought the 32G version while it was on sale for $100 off of the regular price. But, it just isn't the phone for me. By the time I added on my email accounts (I have a lot, including work), the battery drain from all of the Push syncinc of all of the folders was pretty bad. Sent it back after buying a used Note 5.

PROS:

- Comparatively inexpensive for a factory unlocked phone.
- ""Android Only"" with no carrier add-on software.
- Fast charging can pile on a lot of battery power quickly when it's running low.
- Marshmallow is available on this handset, well ahead of anything else out there to get this version of Android.

NEUTRAL:

- Style: Personally, I hated the curved back and the slippery feel of the phone overall. I would have absolutely needed to put it in a case, but I am not convinced that it would have really helped since the cases are ALSO curved.
- Color choices: There are a LOT of options available for this phone, and that's good. But, the sellers on Amazon sell them only in very certain configurations, and that is bad. For example: If you want white with silver, you can only get that in the 16G model. If you want the larger storage of 32G, you can only get that with the champagne trim. In order to get white with silver in 32G (my preference), you have to buy direct from Motorola.

CONS:

- Unlocking the screen felt ""clumsier"" because there are no hard buttons on the face of the phone. And, the sensors that detect your hand and such don't reliably turn the screen on to the unlock mechanism.
- The phone uses no hard buttons and relies on proximity and motion sensing to initially turn the screen on for unlocking. This caused the screen to be on a LOT because of various vibrations and motions, especially while riding in the car.
- Battery life is sub-par. Sure, the battery is removable and it has fast-charge options. But, when I'm not actively using the phone, it was still discharging much more quickly than any other phone I've ever owned.
- ""Android only"" with absolutely NO carrier of Moto enhancements. This makes the phone a fair amount more difficult to set up exactly the way you want or control things easily because there are no add-on shortcuts or convenience buttons.
- The immense amount of configuration options on these phones is great when you buy them. But, if you're like me and keep a phone for 6-12 months and then sell it, this drastically cuts into the resale value since you have to find someone looking for the EXACT way you have your phone configured.
- Fast charging makes the phone fairly hot if you're trying to use it while it's charging.
- Obtaining Marshmallow with AT&T as your carrier currently requires that you pull the SIM and allow it to use ONLY the Wi-Fi connection to check for and download updates. I also saw no discernible difference from Lollipop after the update.
- Apps are laggy even though there is no ""bloat"". Running applications side-by-side with my AT&T Note 5 showed absolutely zero performance improvement in the ""pure"" android version on the Moto X PE compared to Samsung that has AT&T bloatware and Samsung's TouchWiz interface integrated in. In fact, the Note 5 can run the apps with little noticeable lag compared to the Moto X even with power saving being enabled on the Note 5 and not on the Moto X.
- Headphone jack and power jack are at opposite ends. Yep, this is a BAD thing. Because this phone is larger, the best way to keep it secure in the car is in a cupholder. That means you can have EITHER the charger plugged in OR headphones, but not both.
- Power and volume buttons are all grouped together on one side. Although the power button has a texture to it to make finding it easier without looking, it's way too easy to press the wrong button. Power on one side with volume on the other makes it FAR easier to find the correct button without looking.
- Doesn't come with earbuds / headphones","3.0 out of 5 stars"

I read a lot of good reviews of MotoX Style, there was only one article mentioned the TFT display is no good.

I'm very very much disappointed to the TFT display.
It looks blue and purple. The color is not real and hurt my visions.
I had Moto X , Moto X 2nd gen.
The AMOLED display looks warm ;  its color&hue depth are just right.
But the TFT display of Moto X Style 2015 is really bad!!
Why Motorola changed from AMOLED to TFT?
 It seems a very bad choice. The display kills me!

If the next generation of moto X still choose TFT, I will definitely not buy it.

Before you order  it online, please experience it at a local store.
I feel regret that I was in hurry to order it online before Verizon has a show model.

It arrives running an older version of Android, but offers an immediate update to Marshmallow - the latest version as of this writing.
Recommendations:  Use the migration applications before you upgrade, because they aren't offered under Marshmallow, and you have to move your photos and texts the old fashion way.  Then do the upgrade.  Also, you can save money on the phone by buying less than the largest size memory, an shop on Amazon for deals on super fast XD cards.  Get the fastest you can find.  Use the card as adopted storage under Marshmallow.  This has proven to be a great combination for us.  No noticeable slowness using this approach.

Missing seems to be the ability to wake your phone from across the room with ""Ok Googke Now"" phrase as found in prior Moto X models.","5.0 out of 5 stars"

It has a beautiful and large display, it is really fast, the camera is great (it takes a lot of details), the speaker sounds great. Also the Moto voice works really well, is easy to get use to, and it is soo useful (at the middle of the night if you forgot setting the alarm, you only say ""OK Moto X, wake me up at 6 o'clock!"" and its done without even seeing the screen).
Pros:
 1) Excellent display.
 2) Excellent stereo speakers.
 3) Really smooth on whatever application you are using.
 4) A strong main camera. And the front camera is good enough to take good selfies even on the dark thanks to the front flash.
 5) Until nowdays I have no problem with the carrier signal, phone calls or text messages.
 6) It has a micro SD slot! So you can expand your current capacity, you can have photos, videos, music and (on the last Android version) you are able to install applications directly on the micro SD card!!!
 7) It runs the last version of Android (6.0 Marshmallow), and Motorola always get faster Android updates.
 8) Excellent baterry charge, it is really fast. The turbo charger is great, it can charge your phone (almost with no baterry left) in no more than 1 hour!!!
 9) No problem with overheating.
 10) The sound with headphones it really good.
 11) The also great Moto voice (as I mentioned on the beginning).
 12) Really nice size, although it has a huge display the space is use very well. Compare to the iPhone 6 plus and the Nexus 6p (that have the same display size) this phone is considerably smaller.

Cons:
 1) The battery doesn't last as much as you want. Do not expect more than a day with middle (common) use and with 1/4 screen brightness. It seems that the displays kills the baterry.
 2) It don't know if only happens to me but, the active display (calleed by Motorola) it is not working fine in mine device. The problem is that you can't unlock the phone or see a notification (on the active display). I point that this only happens on the active display, with the default unlock and notifications of Android I don't have any problems.
 3) It doesn't come with a fingerprint sensor.

In summary:
 It is a great phone at a middle price point, you get a lot of things for your money. Remember that the Moto voice and the active display you will only find in the Moto X line. There are some competitors on the market and they are also really good (as the Nexus 6p), I think that the decisions will be made on the details (I need a fingerprint sensor?, I want the amoled display instead of the IPS panel?, I want moto voice?, I want active display?, etc).","5.0 out of 5 stars"

That coupled with 3 gigabytes of RAM and their stock Android experience this phone is great but the battery life would be way better I mean with a 3000 milliamp hour battery you would expect at least be able to get through the day and pretty much no matter what I do with this phone I get 4 hours of screen on time which is okay I can live with that, but again I say I'm a little disappointment bunch for what it is its a great phone I can give it a perfect score because of the battery life so 4 stars.

My last test product was the 2013 Moto X. While I never had many positive things to say about the previous phones, the Moto X was my favourite, by far.

I use a company provided phone, so my next phone was a Galaxy Note 4. After 6 months of an extremely powerful phone that was slower to use than my 2013 X, I decided I'd had enough. My only option was to buy my own phone that I could just plug my SIM into. The Pure Edition is carrier agnostic and unlocked, so I had no issues doing just this.

What a difference... all the things I loved about the original X, and more. I'd forgotten how much I missed the Active Display, where the screen pulses to show you what your notification is, and even lets you take a peek at it. The new X improved this ability by adding sensors that detect your movement to show you notifications. A simple wave of your hand towards the phone shows you the time, and what you're missing.

The always listening voice detection was another innovative feature of the original X, and it too appears to be improved on this one. Rather than trying to replace Google's already excellent voice recognition like other's have done, Moto simply extends it. Simply train a trigger phrase, and you can do all that Google Now offers, without having to even touch your phone to wake it. If you feel weird talking to your phone, there's a nice stealth option where placing the phone to your ear as though you were taking a call also acts as a trigger, for a more subtle interaction.

Finally, Moto includes a camera that isn't garbage. Moto's never been known for their cameras, and while not perfect, or on par with the Note and other phones with highly rated cameras, it's pretty good. I'm not a photographer, I just want to snap a decent photo quickly. Quickly this does. My Note may have taken a better photo, but the lag in waiting for the camera caused many missed shots. I can pretty reliably go from a sleeping phone to a photo taken in about 2 seconds. A quick shake gesture to launch the camera followed by a tap on the screen, and it's done. I'm still amazed at how fast it is. If you're used to Moto's old sluggish auto-focus, this is a welcome surprise.

There is zero carrier bloatware on this device. It's a nearly pure Android experience, with a few very useful touches added. I never realized how much I liked what Moto had done with this line, until I left it. Partially due to the lack of carrier additions, and partially due to Mot's commitment to early Android releases, I was pleased to see the latest Android 6.0 upgrade notice waiting for me on first use. I was still waiting for 5.1 on by carrier locked Note 4, nevermind 6.0.

The only downside to the phone, is now my wife and kids want to go back to the X, so I'm going to have to buy a few more.","5.0 out of 5 stars"

The Moto X pure wipes the floor with both of them. You name it. Call quality, responsiveness, the smart Motorola apps (yes, they all work. This thing predicts your voice and movements to the point of it being creepy.. And I have a heavy mixed accent ). Don't worry about the storage - put a 64gig SD and it will format it in a way that it will behave as internal storage. The only draw back is the missing finger print sensor (Apple bought the only supplier), but this device is so smart that you barely notice it.
I cannot believe I got this for $300...

P.S.
I work as system admin, and it's a joke that they give us iphones. You cannot do much with the iOS, and this device being close to base Android is my ideal companion at work.

Update :
Have had it for a couple of months now and still I'm love. Just awesome. It's official - I am a lenovo fan boy now - got their thibkpad idea pad and this is the second Moto X .
A few caveats :
- Battery is to be monitored. Make sure adaptive brightness is on and remove all the bull $$ Google account syncs.
- sucks not to have fingerprint password but the location and smart pass work somewhat. Still...
- I still think it's the best phone around. Just a superstar. Does not feel at all bulky - I put an average case on it and glass screen protector and totally able to use one handed (I am 5-8, average hand size - I have thick fingers but not long and I am perfectly fine w it so is my wife)
The Moto chrome sync which enabled me to text from the broswer via phone has been discontinued. Alas..

Discovered lately:
Omg the speakers are amazing ..
Call quality is superb on both sides
The phone took a few nasty falls w/o case and a little splash - no issues visible thus far

So overall - unless something major happens (which I'll update here ) YOU CANNOT GO WRONG WITH THIS DEVICE !!!

PS
Aparanrly It also looks super impressive in the hand, it was not a factor for me - rather I have been told by colleagues.","5.0 out of 5 stars"

I love the rubber grip at the back (black normal and no customisation in Australia). It feels great to handle with care as my hands are slippery and afraid/paranoid with slipping off my hands. It's the best big phone or phablet at 5.7 you can get. Just a tag fatter than what I really wanted (comparing with iphone 6 plus). Nevertheless is now my primary phone.

The speakers are great as compared to others but HTC one,8,9,10. Is the best as it has 2 front speakers, great for watching youtube. But if you go to the volume at its max, it will crackle and noisy, which a is a little disappointing.

Camera is great, happy about it if you do not compare. If you do, then is nothing special as I came from iPhone 4,4S,5S,6 Plus,6S Plus and Huawei P8. I prefer iPhone ones for dim or lowlight photography and a tag prefer towards Huawei P8 for others for front camera. But then the selfie on Moto X Pure/Style is the best out of those phones.
Waiving at your phone screen for time/notification is very awesome, loving it.
Battery life is really poor, but I have charger in office, home and portable when traveling, so not fussed. Turbocharger is amazing, a plus point here.

Software:

The camera app pre-installed is not good, so do yourself a favour and download a camera app (using CameraMX).
Motorola came with their own pre-installed Moto Voice, which I think is the highlight of the phone. Personally I think is better than 'OK GOOGLE', I changed it to 'HELLO MOTO'. Best slogan ever for a device.

I used it for 1 week only, so not too much I can comment, but definitely the POSITIVES outweighs the NEGATIVES. Hence the 5-star. If I am fussed about the battery, would be 4-star still. Best android phone yet. But would I pay AUD$816 for the RRP? Nope. This phone is best at $500-700.","5.0 out of 5 stars"

I upgraded from a galaxy s4 and this device made me love android again. Was fed up with Samsung's touchwiz version of android plus all the Verizon bloatware made it very slow and laggy. This is very close to stock android with a few nice features added.

The Moto display feature is great, I never have to push the power button to unlock it. Also the Moto gestures for camera and flashlight are very useful. Moto voice needs work though, it is a nice idea but at this point it is just a slower version of the Google now voice features. Having it read out texts while driving is nice, but the voice dictation for replying is hit or miss.

I have noticed no lag whatsoever in the 2 weeks I've had this phone, i turned off the window/app animations in developer options and it is even more snappy. 3gb of ram and the 808 processor are plenty for daily usage. Also the radios/call quality are excellent as well as the WiFi receiver.

 Also,, the screen is beautiful. Extremely crisp and bright. Honestly I don't mind its not AMOLED,, but it would have made the Moto display feature even better.

I am not so picky when it comes to cameras, but the shots I get in well lit to medium lit areas are very good. Low light shots have a lot of noise. Huge upgrade from the S4 camera.

So far the only downside of this phone has been the battery life. It's not bad, but not great either. It gets me from 8am to about 10pm with avg of 4 hrs screen on time texting, browsing reddit/internet, some Spotify and Netflix. However the turbo charging feature makes up for the battery life, gets a full charge in about an hour or less.

All these great features with a $400 price tag,, Moto really hit this one out of the park. Let's just hope it gets speedy updates and a few years of them.","5.0 out of 5 stars"

None of those horrible carrier/manufacturer installed ""garbage"" apps. Incredible performance, responsive screen. Not awful (but not stellar) battery life. Below are the lowdowns on the pros & cons :
PRO - Pure Android, no Garbage apps. Silky smooth performance with that Hexacore processor!
PRO - Still has Micro-SD card support!
PRO - Large, Colorful, Vibrant 1440p screen. 70%+ screen-to-body ratio.
PRO - Rich, Stereo sound speakers. Loud, clear and spiffy!
PRO - Standard micro USB cable support (Lightning charge support as well. Full charge from 3% to 100% in 40ish minutes!).
PRO - Fantastic 21mp camera takes awesome pictures and jives well with the google camera app.
PRO - 5mp ""Selfie"" camera takes decent selfies AND has an included flash!
CONS - Bland design (but who cares, this model is about performance)
CONS - No notification lights (thats right, light wont blink when screen is off for notifications. Kinda bothersome to me...)
CONS - Why do I still have to press 2 buttons for a screenshot? Asus Zenfone2 had a nice ""button map"" feature where I could do that with 1 button if so desired...sigh...
All-in-all a great phone for the price! Carrier freedom (works on GSM and CDMA). I would buy the 16gb or 32gb version, save a few bucks as this has micro SD card support ($15 or lower for a 64gb micro SD card is some decent savings).","5.0 out of 5 stars"

I am still in the process of still getting things set-up. Just BE AWARE that if you upgrade to the new Marshmallow operating system BEFORE transferring the contents from your other phone, you will not be able to do it via Motorola's installed ""Migrate"" function. It was something that I accidentally came across when reading about the new features of the Marshmallow operating system. I had downloaded it but luckily hadn't installed it b/c it takes 25 minutes to install & I didn't have the time before we had to leave the house.

I didn't think I would ever want to get away from my HTC One series but my phone is aging & getting laggy & buggy so I really bought this as a Back-up. I figured since we didn't have insurance on my husband's phone & mine was becoming a bit unreliable we better have something in reserve in case of an accident & price wise this was reasonable for an Android smartphone (esp with the added savings of the Amazon Deal of the Day). I had never held the phone or messed with it before buying it so I was rolling the dice. Hubby's current phone is the Samsung 6 which I'm not totally crazy about but I know Samsung has their fans...

Size is just about perfect. It is larger than my HTC One M7 but I'm still able to handle it in my hand. The length of my middle finger to the first crease on the inside of my wrist is 6.5"". The distance on my palm from the base of my thumb to the base of my ring finger is about the same size as the width of the phone. Since the width of the phone is approx. 3 =/- inches & the way I hold my phone is at the base of my thumb & the joints in my fingers it fits just fine. (I don't have particularly long fingers either). If your hand measurements are at least as long as mine you should be ok.

One other comment I will say is that the soft, rubbery back really isn't grippy to me. In fact it seems like it has almost a greasy feel. I put a TPU cover on my phone anyway & I opted for the white back so that the color was neutral & wouldn't darken the color of my cover. I got a light turquoise-y blue cover that looks like the color of a Tiffany jewelry box. Also, I sometimes throw my phones in my purse & I figured lighter colors would be easier to spot in the dark abyss that is my purse!

Pro's (so far):
NO Bloatware!! All that comes installed is Google apps
Size- I was wanting a larger screen & this fits the bill without the phone being overly huge
Love the feature of the double twist of the wrist opening the camera.
The double shake turns on the flashlight (I'm still perfecting this motion)
Like being able to set ""Safe"" locations which keeps the phone from locking
Separate Micro SD Storage up to 128GB
Quick, Responsive
Keyboard is great with swipe although I do miss being able to long press buttons for certain keys (like exclamation points, etc...)

Cons:
None really yet... will try to update later as I get a better grip & after I install Marshmallow

So there are so many great features to this phone I'm retiring my HTC to be the back-up!

FOR VERIZON CUSTOMERS:  I was still a bit worried about the Verizon activation process. Luckily, others had posted in the questions about how they went about it. I thought I could transfer my sim card from my HTC One M7 but I think they might have a size difference. 1 was described as a Micro Sim Card & the other was described as a Nano Sim Card. Anyway, when I went online to do it I got the message to call Verizon's Toll-Free number. I thought, ""Uh Oh"" this isn't going to go well but one of the other reviewers said to just go to the Verizon Store & get one instead of waiting to have one shipped. Another reviewer said that it could only come ""from Verizon Corporate."" I figured since the two reviewers were somewhat in conflict that the one meant a corporate store as opposed to an ""authorized Verizon dealer."" There are stores out there that you think are the Verizon Corporate stores but are actually just the ""Authorized"" type. I had no trouble getting the sim card & they installed it & had me out the door with the phone in working order.","5.0 out of 5 stars"

The charger still had the plastic on it, new. Saved myself $100.

The 16 GB model isn't enough. I haven't formatted my SD as internal space yet, so my complaints may be void once I do, but the 64 bit processor requires more than double the cache meaning each app install size is at least triple it's download size. Motorola, in their infinite wisdom, also has 4 gigs locked out for the OS, but only uses 2 of it. The end result is this 16 gig phone has less than 10 gigs of usable space, and the extra storage needed for the 64 bit coding leaves under 2 gigs free with all my apps installed. Compare this with my old 16 gig Sony, all else being equal, which had close to 7 gigs free. If you root it, you can shove a bunch of apps into System and free up some space, but that's not the most elegant solution. Just stay away from the 16 gig.","4.0 out of 5 stars"

I haven't had the chance to fire it up yet, but I will say this......for those of you wondering if it is too large.....get that out of your mind.....I have normal size hands and it feels great.....I'm moving from a galaxy s4 and the size difference is not even noticeable due to the ergonomics of this phone......My wife has the Nexus 6 and my kids have the Nexus 5.....the 6 was too big for me and I wanted a QHD display, so the Moto X Pure fit the bill.....I will write my full thoughts after Christmas when I can officially get it up and running....

Just a follow up.....finally got a chance to fire up the new Moto X Pure......what a beautiful piece of work.....the size is perfect for one handed use.....the screen if perfect....no, it does pop out like amoled, but it's truer to natural colors. The camera is great...I've read the reviews, and yes, its not the best in low light, but the pictures in normal condition room lighting and outdoors are fantastic. Phone was at 35% and fully charged to 100% in about 30 minutes. As soon as I turned it on, it was ready to update to Android 6.0.....Updating and downloading along with some you tube and web surfing and it certainly does not run hot......Great phone, The only complaint I have is with Motorola. I tried to purchase the Moto Care extended warranty and it said my time limit was expired....I just purchased it on Dec 17 and it is Dec 25....well within the time frame.....will try to contact Motorola tommorrow.......as far as the phone itself.....if you have any hesitations, put them aside....its fast, its very ergonomic, screen is great, reception is great, speakers are fantastic, and the camera is very good.....BUY IT.....You wont regret it...

Another follow up, lol.....after updating to Android 6.0, my battery life is great....yesterday, I used my phone excessively for me, I took quite a few pics, surfed the web, and watched some you tube.....I turned it on at approximately 6 am and at 10 pm, I still had 28% battery....Still not any sign of running hot, even downloading, watching movies....maybe a little warm, but thats to be expected, but it certainly is not what I would even consider HOT...","5.0 out of 5 stars"

Its a heavy phone feels solid. Phones these days are reviewed based on the materials they use but to me I like picking up a phone that feels like a brick not a hollow fragile device.

The best part about this phone so far is the fact that I don't use it all day when I hop in my car at the end of the day it is still at 93% try ever getting that on my Galaxy S5 and you would think something was wrong. Animations are smooth and it is what stock should be... just a few Motorola Brand apps that can be disabled if you do not want them and the rest is Google developed apps. Pure if you ask me. Not Nexus but that is okay.

I have it activated on Verizon. Don't bother with going to the store if you already have a NanoSIM. If not run to the Verizon store walk up and just ask for a SIM card.... Don't be so lazy that you are willing to wait for overnight shipping get this phone activated today. After you get your SIM just call Tech Support at Verizon at (800) 922-0204 follow the prompts to activate a device (Something like press 1, then 3 for technical support, say ""Activate a device"", and 3 again? Don't take that word for word) when it tells you ""for 4g insert sim and reboot"" stay on the line and press 0. This will take you to a rep and explain you have an unlocked phone and want to activate it. You give them the IMEI, MEID, and NanoSIM ID and 10-20 seconds later your phone will start activating.

The setup and migration was easy. Google knew I have a Samsung  Note 2 and offered to install all the apps I have on that phone to the Moto X. Great. The phone is big, not too big, but the one-handed action may not always be possible in a lot of situations. The OS is Android so there aren't any extra apps to contend with once you log-in Gmail, Now, Maps and the Moto Profile, etc. That is basically it. Pop in a Sim card and a Micro SD and you are set. I took a few pics to get an idea of how the camera performs and the pics so far look okay (on the phones screen). I could not tell if it is camera or the phone screen. I have watch a couple of movies and tv shows and the pic great. Some other reviewers my tout how great the Samsungs screens are, but unless you are performing a side by side, you will not be disappointed. The  two front facing speaker are nice! They make the back facing and downward firing speakers appear dumb, now.

Cons: I am still working on trying to download apps I have purchased form the Amazon App Store. The Amazon Underground apps doesn't show my previously paid for apps in the cloud.

 Design: It has this metal frame which just feels premium but also helps your phone remain cool. The rubber back provides great grip and the Moto logo dimple is pretty helpful for increased grip while your on a call. The bulged metal speaker grills feel quite good too.

 Software: The OS is pure Android with non-intrusive modifications. This phone shall be one of first non-nexus phones to receive the much awaited Android L update. The phone has cute little animations that pop-up on the home screen itself that will pleasantly surprise you. I love the bed-bug.

 The specs are are fantastic and have been tweaked to use the power only when its required.

 The Moto X's Moto Display is absolutely useful. You won't believe how helpful it is until you have used it. And on an average it use less battery than when you repeatedly wake up the phone to check notifications.

 Audio: The frontal speaker is very loud and clear. It has a rich output but not as good as HTC One M8 tough. But having used to M8's sound I personally didn't find it to be that bad. Its more than average. The phone comes with very ergonomic earphone with reasonably deep bass but it feels cheap and lacks a remote to control music playback like ""next"", ""forward"", ""back"" etc. The Phone's earpiece is just a bit low in volume. That would mean you ""might"" struggle hearing in a loud place, but then it has a benefit that the other party's voice is not heard even in a quite room with people in it e.g. conference rooms etc.

 Camera: The camera is not as good as iPhone 5S's or Galaxy S5's but it can be best used in broad sunlight or in bright artificial lights because thats when you would have the least noise.
 The ring flash is just a design and it doesn't have any major impact on the overall picture quality when compared to normal led flash cameras on similar phones. The front camera is slow and not good for taking selfies but I don't use it for that. The good part of it is that it can offer better video chat quality on Skype or Hangouts when on low bandwidth networks like 3G due its low resolution which will consume less data.

 Storage: Before buying the phone, I was wishing hard that the phone to be have a MicroSD slot. But when I actually used it I found it has about 10.66 GB of user space on the device. I have installed all possible messaging and social networking apps, few 2D games, productivity apps ~ 1GB , with about 100 songs ~ 500MB, migrated about 40 photos ~ 50MB and still I'm left with about 8GB of space remaining. Thats should work for an average user.

 Battery: Lasts for a day (10AM to 8PM) with WiFi, 3G, Location turned-on still left with 20%. With an average of checking Facebook, Twitter, WhatsApp updates in about 30 mins frequency","4.0 out of 5 stars"

This is the best smartphone I ever had and I would never part with it. I had it unlocked, rooted, replaced unlocked boot logo, installed TWRP recovery, and Xposed all on the very first day I had it. The screen is huge, a pleasure to view, even in bright light, it ""feels right"" in my hand. It comes with a removable external SDCard, I purchased the 64 GB card for external use.

If you get it with Lollipop Android 5.1.1 like I did, you will want to take that OTA Marshmallow Android 6 update as soon as you can. First run on Marshmallow and you will be asked how you wish to use the EXTSDCard. Removable or remains in phone permanently. If you keep it in phone permanently, all of your internal sdcard just ""goes away"" and the external sdcard becomes the ONLY card on the phone. Which means that extra sdcard space I purchased is flushed down the toilet and I can never remove my 64 GB card. I am sure you can figure out which option I took. I want to actually ""use"" that 32 GB of internal sdcard space, plus use the external 64 GB of card space.

The specs for the phone blew me away, this thing has power to burn, man. No more struggling with apps like ""Facebook Lite"", it never slows down, an can multitask like a mom with twins making dinner, changing diapers, and baking a cake all at once! I get in the car and use the Bluetooth to AUX jack plug for my car stereo, then stream music or news from anywhere in the world, I tap my appointment in Google calendar address and navigation takes me to where I want to go, and then the phone rings, I take the call and the phone does not even break a sweat!

Grab Windroid and unlock your bootloader, then download and install the Clark logo fix to get rid of that ugly unlocked bootloader screen. Also use Windroid to install TWRP recovery and MAKE YOUR FIRST TWRP BACKUP NOW! The phone will never be this clean, and close to new ever again, you want and need this backup in case you lose WiFi during a root attempt that did not work, simply restore the backup and try again.

Rooting is easy but IMHO, there are NO good, custom roms available for it. But that matters not. First thing to go is the Google Now launcher which will tolerate little to no modification and replace it with a good launcher like Nova Prime. Now you have complete control over the desktop and app drawer. Now you want to install Xposed for Marshmallow and add the few modules you need to get pretty icons on the status bar, change the quick tiles layout and contents, add cursor keys in pretty colors, Advanced Power Menu for uber nice Power menu for Off, Reboot to recovery, reboot, soft reboot, or bootloader. The things you can do with Xposed modules is almost endless but do not make the mistake I made installing all of them at once the first time. Many are experimental in Marshmallow, don't work, have bugs, or can cause issues on the phone. Install Xposed modules one at a time, testing for days in between, and if you suffer no ill effects, install the next one. If you do notice any problems after installing an Xposed module, double check the configurations, read the warnings you will encounter, and if it cannot be setup to run harmlessly, remove the module.

I did purchase the SVOX Victoria UK female voice and installed her on my Moto X. Now sultry Victoria speaks the driving instructions and answers my Google questions. A feature I cannot live without is the Moto Voice Commander. I actually use this feature every day, for months, long after the novelty wore off. The Moto voice commander is not only useful, I cannot live without it. ""Set alarm for 7 AM"" ""Okay Paul, setting alarm for 7 o'clock AM"". ""Remind me to buy milk at Publix supermarket"" and when I am at or near the store, Victoria reminds me to buy milk. (Victoria is a paid for SVOX artificial UK female voice, the phone comes with a variety of languages in male and female, no need to buy one.) ""Play Led Zeppelin"" and of course, Moto X does. ""Send text to Paula, I will be a half hour late but have something you will love"", ""Message sent to Paula Pelleteir"". ""Call Jean Claude Mobile"" ""Calling Jean Claude mobile phone"" and I take the call with Bluetooth in my car speakers. ""Navigate home"", ""Navigating home."" Previous voice commanders were toys or slow, Moto Voice is anything but. it is essential, fast, and incredibly accurate. Voice command is often faster than I can do by hand. Not to mention the astonishment on my friend's faces when I use it. Moto Voice will operate all of the hardware on the phone and apps, then defaults to Google for anything it cannot answer directly such as ""Where is the closest Mexican Restaurant?"" Thus Moto Voice is superior to Google Voice as you get Google Voice anyway, plus being able to control all of the hardware and apps on the phone itself. ...did I mention it was fast?

The cameras on the phone take the biggest, most gorgeous pictures I have ever seen from a smarphone. With 2 flashes on the back and one on the front facing camera, you have all your photo and video needs right there, in the palm of your hand. Typical front facing camera photo is 5344x4008 21.42 MP!

With all of this heavy modification capacity and everything you need is included or can be installed, who needs a custom rom anyway? Marshmallow does include Layers so you can theme the phone with layer themes from play store. I am not crazy about the layer themes because they are really ""app skins"" for each app or interface on the phone. And, as beautiful as they are, no developer can possible create a skin for every app ever to be made or every function or UI you may encounter, so the layer themes suffer a big loss of continuity when coming from a beautifully skinned Main Menu to an ordinary Hangouts app. I love this phone and would not sell it for any price. And if you are a rooter or love to customize and modify your own phone, this is for you, man!","5.0 out of 5 stars"

I am someone who wants a zippy phone that can be rooted and bootloader unlocked. I enjoy the latest and greatest version of Android as long as my phone is stable. So far, this has been that phone for me.

The features that I most enjoy about this phone (Pros):
1. Screen - beautiful screen and I believe it is QHD
2. SDCard - SDCard slot so phone storage is expandable
3. Vanilla Android - Pure Android and not much else
4. Speed - This phone is very fast, while not the best processor
5. Front Facing Speakers - These speakers are very loud. This is surprising in a phone. It can scare you at times if you open an app that has a opening sound and the speakers are cranked.

Cons to this phone:
1. Glass - The glass feels slightly cheaper than other high quality phones I've used such as the Note 4, almost flexy. I got used to it very quickly and a glass protector might rectify. Just don't buy the Pleason for this phone.
2. Google Now Voice recognition - At least for now it appears as though you must use Moto app for voice recognition with the screen off. While this isn't a huge deal, it seems to be against the grain as far as pure Android experience.
3. No removable battery - I'm sure I could manage to replace the battery if I had to but I would rather not have to. Why is this not included in phones now? I am not taking a star down for this as this is now the norm while not desirable for power users or any consumer for that matter. Seriously, give me some screws in my phone if that is what you have to do. I don't mind.

Pros that don't apply to me:
1. Can be used on any carrier. I'm on Verizon (via StraightTalk MVNO) but I like the fact that I can use this with anyone. Also a great resell point. All phones should be built this way. Why should I be locked down to any one carrier?

Other phones I've used that are similar:

Moto X Developer Edition
Samsung Galaxy Note 4 Developer Edition
Samsung Galaxy Note 3 Rooted and Safestrap
Samsung Galaxy S4

Of the other phones I've used, only the Note 4 DE comes close here. The main difference there is that the N4 was not a pure Android by default though it could be loaded on the phone (possibly with bugs). The N4 had a slightly better screen and did have the ""Google Voice from any screen"" option built in and it worked.

As you can tell, I really like this phone. I couldn't find anything to warrant a negative star. I will update my review as I use the phone in the coming weeks.","5.0 out of 5 stars"

But pictures still come out clear.  Seems the processing is fast enough to avoid blur unless trying to move the camera in an exaggerated way.

Interface ... very responsive phone, better response than the Samsung Note 4.
Build quality ...  looks and feels good.
The sound ... sound is great for a cellphone, front facing stereo speakers are very clear.
The screen ... coming from an Samsung S3 and Note 4 I have to say I like this LCD better than the Amoled on those two phones.  The Amoled colors are very saturated, where the LCD (especially in Normal mode) looks much more accurate.  Also, comes with Gorilla glass, I looked into this.

It initially felt too big in my hand, but I have grown used to that. I do like the easy to set up, stock android device, but the battery life is very disappointing. It may improve when Marshmallow is released, I understand that it has incorporated many battery saving features, but until then the battery leaves much to be desired. I do like the look of the phone, and although I have gotten used to the increased size, it doesn't quite feel comfortable in my hand. The motions that activate the camera and flashlight are a nice feature, the camera is not as great as Motorola leads you to believe but is adequate. The ability to speak to the phone from across the room, and have it perform an action without being nearby is fun. The front speakers are a nice touch, but have a slight background cracking at higher volumes. The display is the biggest disappointment, my son has a 2014 Moto X and the screen comparison is startling. Put them side by side and the older phone has more color depth, a brighter display, a dramatically clearer picture and much more definition. My other son had a 3rd gen Moto G, it arrived just before I ordered my Moto X and it has a beautiful dispkay. That phone is impressive. It reminds me very much of my Nexus 5, but the battery life is better. I am still considering the return of my Moto X, and possibly going back to the Nexus that I am currently using as a 5in. tablet and waiting for an upgraded Moto X or getting myself a Moto G. The speed, display, size, feel in my hand and stock android experience is very appealing. For $279 the value is beyond compare. I am really impressed with the Moto G  That is a 5 star phone.","4.0 out of 5 stars"

I am going to list the pros and cons of the Moto X Pure in general, and also compare the phone to the Nexus 6. I have included a Winner to each section, which sums up my points. Just in case you don’t want to read my entire review. Hopefully this will help many others who are thinking of making the same  switch that I did. That being said, let's get this review started!

Moto X Pure vs. Nexus 6:

Display: LCD vs AMOLED
I originally was scared to go back to an LCD, I loved the deep blacks of the AMOLED and got used to the saturated colors. After using the MXP for a bit, I genuinely prefer the more natural colors of the LCD. The LCD is also capable of getting much brighter than the Nexus AMOLED, while also getting darker. The Nexus 6 can get almost as dark, but at the lowest setting the colors turn red. Some people may prefer the over-saturated colors and deep blacks of the AMOLED, but I find the LCD blacks are extremely good, and it gets much brighter. The LCD seems to be sharper to my eyes. Keep in mind, the Nexus wins for viewing angles. The MXP viewing angles aren't as bad as people make it seem, but they are not the best.

Winner (in my opinion): MXP. I prefer the brighter LCD, sharper picture and more natural colors.

Size:
If you are not used to a bigger phone, it will take some getting used to. Both the Nexus and MXP will be big if you are coming from a sub 5.5"" display phone. That being said, the MXP is much easier to use. I personally have extremely large hands (all of my friends and family say the Nexus looks like a normal phone in my hands), I did not find the Nexus hard to use. Without a case, the Nexus gave me no issues. Once I put a case on it, I had issues comfortably using it one-handed, mainly because of the width of the phone. The MXP is significantly narrower, and is also not as tall as the Nexus. The MXP being narrower makes it much easier for one-handed use, and I honestly find it quite small now, because I got so used to the huge Nexus.

Winner: MXP. I prefer the bigger screen of the Nexus, but once it is in a case, the width became an issue for me. I have no issues with the size of the MXP.

Camera (MXP has 21MP Back and 5MP Front, Nexus 6 has 13MP Back and 2MP Front):
The Nexus camera was a huge improvement over my Galaxy S4, at least in the picture department. Anyone with the Nexus 6 knows how poor the video quality is. The OIS does not work reliably, and it has trouble focusing during video. The picture quality was better than my S4, but the OIS and focus made it worse than my S4. The MXP does not have OIS, but it has software stabilization. This works much better and more reliably than on the Nexus 6. I made a video of me walking with the MXP, and it barely moved compared to the Nexus 6. The MXP has more accurate colors in both picture and video, and it is a much improved camera overall. The MXP takes much more detailed pictures, and it captures images in HDR faster than the Nexus in non-HDR mode. The wide angle front camera of the MXP is amazing. It has significantly more detail (double the megapixels), more accurate colors, lets in more light, and captures much more in a shot. I used the front flash once, and it's a flash. Not much else to be said. I have no use for it, but for people that want to take selfies in the darkness of them doing weird stuff, you can do that now.

Winner: MXP. The back camera is more accurate, more detailed, and higher quality in general. This goes for both pictures and videos. The software stabilizes videos better than the Nexus 6 OIS. The front camera has a flash (useless to me but could be useful to you), more detail, more accurate colors, and is extremely wide.

Hardware Design:
Both the MXP and Nexus 6 have a very similar design. The aluminum band and button layout are basically identical, except the micro USB charging port is upside down in the MXP compared to the Nexus 6. The back of the phone shows the main differences. I prefer the ring flash of the Nexus, as it gives off a softer flash with a nice oval shape. However, the MXP flash gives off a much more natural color. The dimple placement on the MXP is not as bad as I thought it would be. I thought it was going to be too low compared to the Nexus, but I am used to it already. I personally prefer the bigger dimple of the Nexus, but I still enjoy the MXP dimple. The front of the MXP is different, as it has multiple more sensors compared to the Nexus. These are for Motorola’s software features, which I will get to soon. Both phones have front facing stereo speakers.

Winner: Tie. I prefer the white front of the Moto X, while I also prefer the ring flash and bigger dimple on the Nexus 6.

Software:
The software on both phones is virtually the same, except a few things. The Nexus is the only device that uses Google's Dialer, which lets you search for businesses within the dialer. Also, if you have your data on and receive a call or place a call to a business, Google will show the contact name for that business when you call. Motorola has its own software that many people have already talked about. You can use Moto Voice to do voice actions with your phone, and you are able to set a custom command. I don't want to waste your time reviewing the software as they are similar except for the Motorola software.

Winner: MXP as it adds many useful Motorola features. The Google Dialer is the best dialer to me, but the useful Motorola software is even better. The Nexus will get updates first, which is the biggest reason I got the Nexus in the first place.

Customization:
The Nexus has two options: Midnight Blue and Cloud White. The Moto X lets you choose different textured backs, including leather and bamboo. I always loved the look of the White Front and Bamboo Back Moto X, so that is what I got this time. I love it. The bamboo looks great, and is extremely soft and grippy.

Winner: MXP. The Nexus doesn’t really offer customization.

Speakers:
Both phones have front stereo speakers. The Nexus 6 speakers get louder, but they sound quite similar overall. The MXP speakers can crackle at very loud volume on certain notification ringtones. I have not heard cracking during video though. I am not sure if this is hardware or software related, but it has not made me want to return the phone.

Winner: Nexus 6. The speakers are louder and do not crackle.

Battery:
The Nexus 6 has quite poor battery life overall for me. I mainly use LTE, and I get good signal on Verizon. The Nexus can last me a day, but not much longer than that. So far, the MXP gets better battery life for me. I will have to test this more, but it seems that the battery is significantly better. Yesterday, I used data for quite a while, texted, called, listened to music while studying for 10 hours. The phone was on for a total of 21 hours, and I had 2 and a half hours of screen time, with 30% battery left. I could have easily gotten 3 hours of screen time, and this was with heavy usage for me. The Nexus would have 100% been dead in a similar time frame for me.

Winner: MXP.

Overall, I prefer the MXP. The customization was a huge selling feature for me, as I really loved the White Front and Bamboo Back. The battery, camera, and display are all improvements compared to the Nexus (at least in my opinion). The screen size is still quite good, while being a lot narrower than the Nexus, making one hand usage much more manageable for many of you. My personal recommendation is that the MXP is a superior phone to the Nexus 6. Granted, it is guaranteed not to receive updates as fast as the Nexus, but I am confident it will be a close second. Only time will tell. I plan to update this review if anything in my opinion changes. I also will update the review once my phone receives the Android 6.0 Marshmallow update.

10/06/2015: I have added some photos that I took here. Amazon most likely will lower the resolution. The colors of the photos are very accurate, and each photo has a very large amount of detail.

10/31/2015: I've taken a lot of front camera photos now. I never really used the front camera on my previous phones, but the higher megapixels and wide angle lens really makes me want to use it. The photos always come out great, and I actually have used the front flash multiple times. It does not blind me, which was my biggest concern with a front flash. I have done some 4K video footage now, and it stabilizes just as well in 4K as it does in 1080p. The stabilization is not the absolute best when compared to other phones, but I find that it works great. I still stand by everything in my review. I currently am using the Incipio Octane Clear/Frost Case, and I highly recommend it. I'll be sure to keep this updated if anything changes.

01/27/2016: I have been trying to edit this review for months now, but it would not work. I have contacted Amazon many times, and it seems they have finally fixed my issue. Anyway, I have taken a large amount of photos with this phone now, and I really enjoy the camera. I will try to post more pictures soon, because I only included two photos in my initial review. I updated my phone to Marshmallow about a month ago, and it's been great so far. My apps stay open in the background even when I open 5 or more apps. I had trouble on Lollipop where after opening about 3 apps, my other apps would close. Marshmallow seemed to have fixed this for me, which is extremely helpful. My battery life does not seemed to have changed with Marshmallow. I was hoping that the Doze feature would improve my standby battery life, but it has not. The battery is not bad, it has always lasted me an entire day of full usage in the few months I have owned the phone. I am now using a Case-Mate bumper case, as I wanted some protection but wanted to feel my Bamboo back. Otherwise, everything in my review still stands. I have dropped the phone twice with no damage at all, which is great. It seems durable so far. If anything changes I will be sure to update my review again.","5.0 out of 5 stars"

I returned it and I can tell you that Amazon is the best, they sent me another right away. I received the second one and it did not crash, it seemed to be working fine but it suffers from lag when going from screen to screen and opening apps, also the phone heats up in my pocket from time to time. I also noticed the screen is usually warm even when I'm not doing anything on it. There seems to be some bugs that are not worked out.

This phone is probably one of the best android phones out right now, taking into consideration the aesthetics, comfort in hand, and specs. I grabbed this during the sale and definitely made the right choice. No carrier versions on this phone is a HUGE plus and being able to take complete control of the phone is a wonderful thing. No more issues where carries don't care to keep the phone updated and no more locked phones! Although a step below the Nexus 6p in some specs and has a larger development community, I still would recommend the Moto X over the 6p, because it is more comfortable in hand, better aesthetics, the camera quality is still fairly close (in good lighting, not in poor lighting), and also Motorola has included some very nice features in the software, such as Moto Display and gestures (such as chop for flashlight).","5.0 out of 5 stars"

To be honest, I was not too thrilled when it comes to Motorola, since they history past StarTac hasn't been all that great (great, just know how old I am now)

But playing with multiple phones in the last few years, I think this phone is a pretty good deal, with a few points to take into when considering this phone.

1. Size. 5.7"" ain't for everyone, especially for those with smaller hands. I played piano for close to 10 years and can stretch 9 octaves without a problem, but sometimes I find this phone a handful. The back of the phone is craved and a dimple is made of the Motorola mark, but still, it can get kinda hard to hold sometimes. I am still waiting for a better case to arrive, since the one that comes with it is very flimsy, and I have dropped it more than once already and it ain't day two yet.

2. Speed. Granted, not top top-of-the-line, but really, SD 808 is more than enough to handle what I throw at it. Social media, mail, work, game. I did notice that after maybe 30 minutes of gaming, the top part of the phone would get kinda warm, not hot, but noticeably warmer. But performance doesn't fail even if that happens. I only had the Google Calendar FC on me once when I was putting in an appointment, but hey, they are bound to hiccup once in a while, right?

3. Battery life. I know people would kill over this, but I think 3000 mAh is more than enough for a full day of use, assuming you are not working with your phone all day. I can unplug around 8am and still have roughly 36% by 11pm, which is pretty much unheard of. Ok, maybe unheard of before quick-charge (TurboPower charge) came along. The TurboPower charge is something that I find very interesting. I used to work with mobile devices, and I know that if you try and juice it more than it can take, you are blowing it. But after using it a couple of times, not only did it charge fast (I can get from 5% to full in under 1 hour, since I left it there and took a nap), but I don't see any sort of electronic damages, yet. But given what the technologies that are out there now, I think we should be fine.

4. Carrier. As much as I hate to say this, I hate to be ""tied"" to a certain carrier, not that I switch that much, but I travel internationally quite a bit, and having the freedom of just popping a local sim-card and be on my way is pretty awesome. Motorola X Pure Edition gives me that freedom, since it is unlocked!

With all things, not everything is all glitters, there are some drawbacks, too.

The grip. Make sure you get a case that has a good grip, I just don't see how people are able to use it without a case and still manage not to drop this phone.
Space. I know, this goes both ways, but hey, at least it supports micro SD cards, so go pop a card in and you are fine for your pictures and videos.
Camera. This, again, is personal, but I think the Motorola Camera app is way too bright and the pictures are not as sharp as if I were using a Google Camera app. But, make it what you will, I have both apps and considering a third, just to try it out. I know this might be a deal breaker for many, and right now, I am still adjusting to it.

All in all, I think this is a solid phone, for a good price (how I wish it under $399). If you hate paying to the carriers for your phone, pick up an unlocked phone for your sake, and give this phone a try if you like big phones!","4.0 out of 5 stars"

Now before I bought this back in October (I think), I was debating on which nexus phone I should get, the 5x or the 6p. Then stumble a cross this Motorola phone, the Moto X PE, I began to do a little bit more research into this and to my pleasant it had a lot features that I have come to enjoy in a smartphone: fast charging, expandable storage, pure android and a good starting price. Now I never a Motorola phone before,  the last Motorola phone I use and it was mine was that razor from 2003 (I think).

After doing a lot going back forth debating over the nexus 6p and PE, and after debating I chose the PE for many reasons, the biggest being price.  I soon order mine from moto maker, and a week later I got it.  The first thing that I realized that this is big phone and I have never had 6 inch before after a little while came to enjoy a phone of this size.

After about 6 months of using the PE I have come to enjoy this phone.

Pros:

Price (399 usd at the time)
Charges fast (around 40 mins or so)
Great screen
Has excellent speaker quality
Expandable storage
Great daytime photos
Near pure android ( the moto apps are nice )
Unlocked
Feels very nice in my hands

Cons:

No fingerprint reader (I knew that before hand)
Ok battery (almost a days worth of use for me)
Bad low light photos (I'm not a person that uses the camera that often, so not a big for)
16GB (this was the thing I regret the most, don't get the 16GB, I found that apps don't run very fast on an sd card and that that it only came with 9.5 usable GB)

So all'n all I enjoy the PE,  is it for everyone? No, but for the price, it's hard to beat and I would recommend this phone to anyone interested.","5.0 out of 5 stars"

Out of nowhere the display went all white with grainy lines running vertically down the screen.  I have seen this before on occasion in older smartphones do I decided to take the battery out.  Oh, wait.  You can't do that on this phone so I could only force reboot with the power button.  Held it down for about 7 seconds and it powers off and it comes back on...but without the good news I was hoping.  The display is still screwed up.  I knew that it was over already.  So I played with it until the battery died and left it off a while but it wouldn't correct itself.  I did call Amazon and I was promptly refunded and even told I could keep the paperweight.  I guess I'll sell it on eBay as is and make the few dollars back I spent on a case and screen protector for it.  I guess I just had horrible luck getting a faulty display device.

The best thing is that unlike other phones, i can activate voice commands to call someone else without turning on mobile data or wifi. For me who was on a limited data plan, this is one of Moto X's appeal. Google Now or Siri would have required an internet connection to work. Considering all those,  when it comes to switching to a new phone, the Moto X Pure Edition naturally came to my mind.

I've been using the phone for a month now, and I'm quite happy with it. Now, let's get right down to the Pros and Cons:

Pros:
- User experience - I multitask a lot and this phone handles switching applications flawlessly. I can run heavy apps on here with no problems
- Brightness level - I only have this at <30% but everything is still as bright as day
- Colors and interface - apps, images, videos and colors render sharp and beautiful. No complaints here.
- It's huge - This is both a pro and a con for me. I love using the phone because of how big and clear the text and images are. Watching videos is great on here as well. My SO kept asking me to trade his phone for mine lol. Also, the phone is wide and tall but feels really slim in my hands due its thinness.
- MicroSD card slot - 'nuff said
- Turbo charger - LOVE this. Don't know how many this has saved me, but this thing gets you up and running in a pinch. The way it works is that it allows for more electricity to flow into your phone (while still keeping it at safe levels) to fast charge your phone to around 50% in 30 minutes. Then, to preserve your battery, it charges at the regular speeds until full (but still faster than regular charger)
- Active Display - this is something unique about the Moto X. You can wave your hand over the phone to check the time and notification. You can twist your wrists twice to get the camera running. It will read text messages out loud if it detects that you're driving. You can also do the chopping motion twice to turn on flashlight, but that doesn't work for me all the time, personally.
- And as mentioned above, a great perk of this phone is that certain voice commands (e.g. ""Call my cat (provided yours has a phone),"" ""Find my phone""...) are possible without mobile data or wifi. This feature rolls under Moto X's Active Display

Cons:
- Call volume - The phone's speaker is loud for all things... except calling. I read somewhere that it may be a software thing rather than hardware, and that a future update may fix it. Not sure if that's true, but currently, I can play music or watch videos on high volume; but with phone calls, even on max speaker, it isn't that loud. This is a minus for when you're in noisy places or on the road.
- It's a phablet - yup, the phone is big. There's no way I can text with one hand on this phone. It's not a big deal anymore since I don't do it that often, but that would have been nice.
- Battery - nothing to write home about. I get a good day out of it with medium/heavy use.
- Heat - the phone can get quite hot if you're running demanding games

In conclusion, I would say this phone is a great purchase. I did a lot of research into different phones and finally settled on this one. Its pros outweigh its cons and there are so many pluses about it. I did have to return my first one bought here on Amazon because the screen got wonky on me in the first week. I ordered a replacement and have been using this for a month with no problem.","4.0 out of 5 stars"

The phone was sold as a new phone, however what was delivered was clearly not new. The packaging had been relabeled, and re-taped shut, not factory sealed. The box was also dirty on top.

Despite the obvious issues with the packaging, I opened the box, hoping for the best. You see, I really want this phone! Inside I found a phone without its original plastic screen protector. The screen had a small blemish that was not dirt, but physical damage. The front flash was not flush with the screen, but stuck up above the screen surface. And finally, both power button and volume rockers were loose to the point of rattling when the phone was shaken or it vibrated.

Clearly the phone is being returned, and no replacement requested. This is not my first time through this process. A couple months ago I attempted to purchase the same phone, but has similar difficulties. Both 1st and 2nd phones appeared to be new and were in factory sealed boxes, but has a problem with static noise in through the handset earpiece when on calls. The 3rd phone, like this one, was not new, and happened to exhibit the same loose power button and volume rocker issue.

In total that is 4 phones through Amazon, none of which were defect free, and two not even new. Very disappointing since the Motorola Moto X Pure Edition is such a nice phone at a very fair price. Given the large number of happy MXPE owners, I know this poor quality issue is not a given. But it seems that Amazon is dealing with less than normal quality stock in addition to selling ""not-new"" items as new.

The attached photos show what was seen from sealed box to freshly opened. The blue paper cover over the bumper was actually crooked as shown. Who knows what was going on with the labels on the box.","1.0 out of 5 stars"

A lot of it is copy and pasted because much of the device's initial strengths did not change. Here's what a month with the Moto X Pure Edition looks like at a glance.

Design/Build:
Silver frame and bamboo back cover, as I said previously. It does feel awkward in the hand at first, but after a couple days you begin to really fall in love with the size of the phone. It being mostly screen lends more support to that claim. The bamboo is actually grippy contrary to popular belief, and the aluminum frame is shiny and premium (really the only visually premium aspect).

Display:
Its 2560x1440 LCD screen is phenomenal. Crisp and vibrant colors pop even in direct sunlight, and the stock Android OS looks oh-so-beautiful in qHD resolution. The LCD gets far brighter and dimmer than the AMOLED display, and has more natural colors to it. I actually prefer it now. The Moto Display also doesn't light up a room. It may not be ""true"" black, but hey, it's still black. It won't be an eyesore in the middle of the night or in a dark room. All-in-all it's one of the best screens I've ever seen and used.

Hardware/Performance:
The Snapdragon 808 hexa-core and 3 GB of RAM is still unbelievable. This phone is blazing fast. I've had it now for a month, and it hasn't even shuttered, lagged, or froze for any reason at all. It handles anything I throw at it, from graphics-heavy games, to opening Facebook, to replying to a text, and then right back to where I left off in said game.

Software:
After putting the MXPE up next to a Nexus 5 and 6, I noticed something: they look, feel, and operate the same way. This is basically a 5.7"" Nexus device. That being said, Moto Voice is much more intuitive than Google Now. You can set the phrase to whatever you please...no more ""OK, Google."" Now it's ""Hey, What's Up Moto"" or, in my case, ""Gouvia to Enterprise."" Gestures let you flick your wrist to launch the camera, chop twice for the flashlight, and lift the device for discreet, in-ear voice commands (for those who feel they look silly talking aloud to their phone in public). Be weary though: the gesture functions don't work perfectly. If you don't get the motion down JUST right, they simply don't work. But I've noticed they can be SLIGHTLY lenient in how the gestures are performed. The software behaves as pure stock Android is meant to, with a few very impressive additions from Motorola.

Camera:
The initial impression was positive, and the current impression is...well, still mostly positive. The back camera packs a 21-Megapixel punch and photos in broad daylight are beautifully shot. Indoor shots though...I've noticed that they really only require patience. If you're looking to snap something amazing in front of you at that moment, and the lighting isn't good, then well, good luck. But 8 out of every 10 desired shots came out wonderful for me. The front camera is 5-Megapixels with its own LED Flash and honestly, if it isn't absolutely black in the room or outside, don't bother with the flash. The slightest bit of lighting renders it useless being so close to the subject. But hey, it should ne nice to know that it does well when it's absolutely needed.

Battery:
Not bad at all: with 3000 mAh, it started at 9:00 AM and went 12 hours of constant use, ending at roughly 35%. And the best part: TurboCharging. This bad boy can take you from 1% to 50% in maybe just under 20 minutes. With a battery safe enough to handle quick charges like that, who cares how long the battery lasts through the day? 15 minutes on this cord will get you an extra 6-10 hours no problem.

Consensus:
At one month in, I can say one thing about the Moto X Pure Edition that I could NOT say about any other phone I have EVER owned: it shows no downsides. I can't find a single hardware quirk, or software issue/bug, or inconsistency with what Motorola has indicated. In fact, if your device does have any of those, it's probably a faulty model and I implore you to return it for another, because this phone in many ways is a Nexus to compete with the current Nexus. Side by side there's no difference, and like I said, the Moto enhancements actually make the experience...better. So for $400=$500 you get a largely unrivaled software experience, a very personalized device, a microSD slot, carrier freedom, and a budget device you can actually show off to your friends...and you're giving what up? A fingerprint sensor and a USB standard that isn't yet standard? This device might as well be a flagship killer, and might as well be Motorola's best work to date.

Package was in pristine condition when it arrived at my doorstep.

This device is great for the price. After a month of use the things I enjoy most are quick charging, QHD screen, Moto Assist, front facing speakers and the overall smoothness of the pure Android experience. The battery life is average at usually 3.5 hours of screen on time but the thing I love most about this phone is how little drain there is over a long sleep period. I wake up to a drop of not more than 3% over about 6 hours of sleep time. That plus the quick charging capabilities makes for a better battery experience than I had with my old OnePlus One.

The built in Moto features are great to use and I like how they are unobtrusive in the way they operate. The gestures to launch the camera or the flashlight are pretty intuitive as I've never had to use their respective apps.

The camera is well above average but not in the league of the LG and Samsung 2015 flagships I've tested. Honestly, every phone outdoored this year is capable of taking great photos but the consistency on the average user's auto mode is what sets them apart. Since I'm not a camera person the extra $200 for accuracy doesn't cut it for me.

I don't like the fact that the phone charger isn't a two piece USB and brick type. This makes it impossible to connect the phone to a computer for data transfer or charge.

Although the sound from the speakers remain high quality at high volume levels I've noticed a crackle from them when notifications come through. It doesn't happen when I watch videos though so I'm not sure if it is a hardware or software issue.

I got the 32gb configuration and thus far it's been a more than worthy experience for the amazing price. I eagerly await the Marshmallow update","5.0 out of 5 stars"

Motorola customer support is simply abysmal. Look around and you will see this common theme throughout the 1 star reviews for Motorola products. I had the misfortune to crack my screen, and went back and forth with them abiut the return and replacement process.  Once I arranged to send in my broken phone, they decided for some reason not to accept THEIR OWN PRIOR **WRITTEN** QUOTE and raised the fees.  I attempted to escalate the ridiculous decision to a supervisor and got no response. Either the rep lied and just hung up, or the supervisor doesn't care. Either way this experience reinforces the multitude of other bad experiences with Motorola support.

The product is good and I would really like to buy from a US company... But I would not wish an encounter with a moto support line on an enemy. It made me place my first review after years and hundreds of products purchased on Amazon. Do not trust them unless you can buy it as a disposable device.","1.0 out of 5 stars"

Pros- love the size of this phone, operating system is great, the moto voice feature is nice also, the camera is great and the pictures come out wonderful
Cons- I miss the color LED feature my Samsung had (not sure if I can't find where to do this but have had no luck) the phone is also a little heavier than I thought it would be, the vibrate on this phone is extremely loud and is kind of annoying if it goes off at night, I don't like that I can't close all open apps at once but have to close one at a time

Yeah, it's huge but it's not bulky. The screen is massive but somehow it still fits nicely into my hand like the much smaller 2013. To keep it short and simple, here's what I love about it that's new. The screen gets so much brighter and so much duller, which is great for using my phone in the dark. The front facing speakers sound amazing and get quite loud. Battery life has definitely improved; played music on it via Bluetooth for a 5 hour carride and it only ate through about 30% of the battery while my Moto X 2013, sitting in the passenger seat doing nothing but being on, bit 40%. The material of the phone feels great, the camera is much improved, the wide angle lens is wonderful, and I love that I could just pop my old SIM card in (and a 64GB memory card!) and get to work. Got all my old messages and call logs with the help of Migrate. Overall, it only took about 2 hours for me to get completely settled into it. Unless you really really know you don't want a bigger screen, I'd definitely recommend giving this phone a try. It's great.","5.0 out of 5 stars"

But after a few months you can tell they cut corners somewhere to reduce the price. A few times the screen would go bonkers and just show lines, chalked it up to a crash and restarted it. Then red spots on the LCD showed up they never went away. Finally the screen just turned a horrible yellow tint. So I started a warranty replacement online with the advance exchange option which allowed me to keep my current phone until I get the replacement. That costs $25 plus a ~$600 credit hold.

About a week passed and I get the replacement phone, now this is where the real fun starts. The replacement phone screen is very dim even when turned up to full brightness. The screen has yellow spots right out of the box. The back plate lifts off the phone from not being seated correctly. I put my SIM card in and no signal the SIM slot doesn't even work. So after many calls and emails to customer service I've finally got to the point of getting a replacement for the replacement not sure when I will see another phone and hopefully that replacement works.","1.0 out of 5 stars"

I'd already ordered a Sandisk 128GB sd card, and when my phone showed up, I was immediately up and running with around 190GB of storage!  I do a lot of photography and videos, and space wasn't something I wanted to worry about.

In this review, I am focused on video.  The Moto X Pure Edition has PDAF (phased-detection-auto-focus) which is a fluid and fast technique to auto-focus.  The technology behind it relies on detecting phase shifts in light as they appear in the sensor (actually special sensors embedded and spaced throughout among the normal sensors).  Based on that, its able to find contrasty things in your photo or video to focus.  When recording video, you don't want to fumble with the phone; you simply want to hold it steady and record.  I shoot a lot with the Canon 5D Mark 2, and even on a prosumer dSLR like that, there is no PDAF!

I'd also recommend a tripod with a head allowing you to tilt and pan.  What I found useful is to not tilt and pan too quickly.  Otherwise the video naturally becomes choppy.  While Motorola states no OIS on the phone, hand-held footage seem to be stabilized somehow and very usable.

Anyways, I spent a day filming in San Francisco around the Golden Gate Bridge, and the result is absolutely amazing!  This video, which contains raw footage directly from my Moto X Pure Edition, was shot in 4K.  (In order to upload to Amazon, I had to shrink it down to 720p.)  Besides speed-ups or slow-downs, there was no retouching of the color, exposure, or any sort of post-processing.  This is raw footage from the phone!

I love this phone!

You can also see the video in 4K in my Youtube channel (as well other footage):

It hardly fits in my skinnyish jeans pockets. Now I am carrying it in a belt holster and it's almost perfect.

If you are a minimalst like me, you would love these combination:

Back to Moto X pure. While I love this phone the main complains comes down to:
1. Battery life
2. LCD Display
3. Charger

Let me explain.

The battery life simply sucks. The problem is not so much the battery itself but the LCD TFT display. While it is a nice natural colored display, it consumes over 40% of battery life. Another negative of LCD TFT display is, it's hard to see under sunlight. They really should have used AMOLED display instead but I guess they chose LCD to keep the cost down. Large display makes it as a great tablet substitute, but the short battery life requires you to ration the screen on time.

For example, If I use the phone for web browsing, texting, emailing or whenever I use the display constantly, the battery lasts may be 4 hours. If I use it as a mp3 player or listening podcast with headphone with display turned off, the battery lasts entire day.

25w Turbo charger charges super fast. That's great. But it's kind of hard to find the replacement charger. You are pretty much stuck with Motorola's OEM charger if you want the Turbo charge speed. Worst thing is it seems like there is no compatible battery power bank. Since the battery life does not last a whole day, battery power bank would be a life savor. But it seems like that's not an option for Moto X pure.

Pro:
- Works with Ting (T-mobile) flawlessly.
- Fast
- Great Audio quality (far better than my macbook air). Front facing speakers.
- Love the ""shake on"" camera feature
- Turbo charger super fast charge.
- Pretty decent photo quality.

Con:
- Short battery life
- The screen is too dark under sunlight
- Turbo charger wall adaptor is somewhat hard to find.
- No compatible battery bank (as far as I know)
- Large
- Motorola is now owned by Lenovo","4.0 out of 5 stars"

In the end, I decided the Moto Voice feature was the one thing I had gotten used to on my previous phone which I could not live without.  I've been very happy with this phone and have no regrets.

I am not going to sugar coat anything folks. I've had this phone for 3 days and was insane enough to test its durability with a case purchased from Amazon. It is an expensive phone to purposely drop. But I can rest assure you that I have extensively let this handset fall onto hard wood. Marble and the screen and phone itself were remained undamaged. I've dropped it into the snow and wiped the snow from the display and kept using it without any issue. And the phones display is made of Corning gorilla glass according to my research. so those that spoke of a cheap screen may have gotten a bad batch. I've had straight talk issues after switching to this unlocked phone. It's not the phone. It was my service. The phone works great in overall functionality. The speakers kick ass at sound quality. The rear camera is very clear and crisp as well as the front facing. I bought the phone from best buy at destiny USA. I felt the need for a new dependable phone after switching from LG for 2 and a half years of their excellence. So this phone needed to be put to the test. I purchased it after the Android marshmallow update. Which I just said heck with it and installed. The update works fine. And overall I'm loving this device. I will be sure to keep an update as time passes. The upper speaker distortion that has been mentioned has not been an issue to me. You can hear it but you need your ear close to the phone. I think it also depends on what you are listening to that makes the crackle noticeable. I've had the phone call voice mail and send a text from my pocket. But I had a Google chrome page open that spammed a few pop ups and must have woke the screen up. No issues since then. I've seen a review on here of a owner that has had the phone a year and had no issues. That's quite reassuring. For anyone who has garbled in call issues with the person on the other line. Try turning off the 4g LTE enhanced mode in >settings>more>cellular networks. Even though it's a recommended setting. It fixed the issue for me. Another issue I have ran into was the fact that Facebook messenger notification sounds seem to ascend like ringtones for some strange reason. Making it impossible to hear a notification on messenger's default ding sound. I found a workaround. If you have upgraded to marsmallow, Unfortunately you need to disable chat heads or disable permit drawing over other apps within Android. You should hear it just fine after. The only drawback is that you will receive an Android notification in the notification drawer instead of a pop-up chat head. For quicker access just put messenger on your home screen.","5.0 out of 5 stars"

If you want ""pure"" Android and latest updates and patches then go with this device and has the Snapdragon 808 (DecaCore 64 bit) instead of the 810 like a lot of newer phones which are throttled down to prevent overheating and produces lag, which is where the 808 performs better and a lot of benchmarks.

I had the Nexus 6 (Snapdragon 805 Quadcore 32bit) before jumping to this device and I like this device better seems to be snappier and with the SD card slot and the Marshmallow SD functionality where it merges your SD and internal storage into non removable storage it turns this phone into a storage beast so I have 64GB internal + 128 Samsung EVo Pro and I think this will last me quite a while.

I explained this to the rep at the store and it was done in all of 10 minutes (minus the wait time) in the store. I've had no problems since.

There aren't any garbage apps taking up memory like with the Samsung phones. You can also download the Moto Migrate app, which will bring everything from your old phone to this phone- apps, pics, etc. The screen is large, and the brightness and color are all customizable. There is a function for the phone to select optimum brightness depending on lighting in any given situation. it has a lot of features like smartlock, which will allow you to store trusted places so that you don't have to unlock the phone each time when using it at home, for example. There are a lot of voice activation features, which are easy to use. The camera opens with a shake of your wrist. It really is a beautiful phone, kind of heavy and not so slim, but easy to handle. I can generally write texts etc and manage it with one hand.  I love it so far and hoping I get more than a year out of it since that's about all I've been getting with my Galaxies before they start going downhill. I got the 32GB phone, and it stores a lot. You also have a space for a memory card for additional storage of photos and things like that. I haven't tried to save anything other than photos to the external memory card yet.
Overall, a lovely phone that's customizable in a number of ways.
Just take my advice if you're a Sprint customer and get the SIM from Sprint ahead of time.","5.0 out of 5 stars"

VERIZON users:  Don't get too discouraged by trying to get this going on VZW.  I spent an hour at a corporate store yesterday trying to get this activated.  No luck (and I only ordered the phone AFTER checking with both Verizon and Moto).

The problem lies with Verizon's antiquated activation system.  Their system, designed obviously to keep customers and make choice and variety as limited as possible to keep you in their ecosystem, cannot register a new SIM to a phone not in their system (they don't sell the Pure).

The work arounds:

1. Talk to CS and have them send you a Nano sim for your phone number.  That ""should"" work.  They won't do this in store (they aren't trained to), but getting on chat got me one shipped immediately.

2.  OK I decided I didn't want to wait until next week for the Nano SIM.  My current phone is a Galaxy Noote 3, it has a Micro not a Nano.  Hmmmm.  I took some scissors out and cut that down to fit in the Nano slot (yes, this is a normal procedure, Amazon even sells cutters for this purpose).  Guess what?  Viola, fired up just fine and is working perfectly.  Of course if your current phone has a Nano then you're good to go without doing anything.","5.0 out of 5 stars"

Good solid build, a bit large for people who rather a phone they can use with one hand.  32GB model is great with 3GB RAM so it's fluid.  I haven't had any hardware or software issues (other than what I'm about to describe below).

For me, this is why it didn't get a 5-star.  Out of the box,the product was HORRIBLE.. why? Erratic screen flickering / ghost touch. Contacted Motorola who said they could only replace the phone and that I should ask Amazon to process a refund or replacement. Little tinkering around online and I found out that I should downgrade to Android 5.1.1 and ever since, no screen flickering issues.  Apparently the screen issues will be resolved with Android 6.1 update, but for now, the phone is functional on 5.1.1 and I'm satisfied so far.

Also, why is there no USB data cable? It comes with a wall charger... not a 2 in 1 wall-charger / detachable data cable. Smh.

UPDATE:
The screen issues came back up and now the phone is completely unusable. Seems I got the 1 out of 10,000 or so that has a manufacturing defect. Some guy suggested it's an inherent issue with TFT screens, so from my experience, I'd recommend AMOLED. Loved that phone... but... :(","3.0 out of 5 stars"

The general consensus online seems to be that phones get hot when you are first setting up so I thought this was normal.

However, over the next few days it would start to get really warm. The phone would be inactive for hours but would get hot within a few minutes of me surfing the internet or watching YouTube videos. I understand that phones get warm but 30 seconds of a YouTube video shouldn't be enough to make it get warm especially if it hasn't been used for hours.

My phone would get hot around the top half of the screen/earpiece and on the back around the M dimple. It made it very unpleasant to hold the phone with or without a phone case.  The fact that the earpiece gets hot worries me because it could hurt someone who holds their phone to their ear when they make phone calls.

There are other people who seem to have this problem (a google search shows a few threads on other websites discussing this issue) however most reviews I have watched or read do not report this.

My phone may have just been defective but I decided to return it. Hopefully the return process goes well because my experience with this phone was unsatisfactory. This was meant to replace my 2nd gen Moto G but I will have to look consider a different company.","1.0 out of 5 stars"

The camera is good -- better than my wife's iPhone and comparable to any phone camera I've seen.

Battery life is comparable to my S4 when it was new; but the TurboCharger is extremely fast. It went from a 10% charge to fully charged in under 40 minutes. I could see the battery meter counting upwards.

When I took it to the Verizon store to get a new SIM Card, the guy that helped me was so excited to see it he brought two of his co-workers from the back to admire it. They were raving about it, calling it things like ""extremely responsive"", ""perfect amount of grip on the back"", ""wow, you don't even need a case if you don't want one"", etc. I've never seen a group of people at a cell phone store rave over a phone like this.

I generally have avoided devices with such large screens, but the very narrow bezels and other proportions make it feel smaller in the hand. I also use a TPU case to minimize accidental touches to the screen (due in part to the narrow bezels), but if that's not a problem for you, the standard back is a ""grippy"" rubbery plastic, which helps the phone feel more secure in the hand.

I ordered it customized through MotoMaker and got the 16GB model with black front, teal back, and metallic blue accents. First off, I love the phone aesthetically. My phone before this was the original Moto X, AT&T carrier locked. I had a Moto X Phone Case, SUPCASE Unicorn Beetle Series Premium Hybrid Protective Bumper Case for Motorola Moto X Phone, Frost Clear/Black [Free HD Clear Screen Protector, Bubble Free Installation Instruction Included], which covered the majority of the accents (the power button and volume rocker), and the supposedly clear back hardly showed my customized phone. I have a Casemate bumper on the phone now, which allows you to actually see the back and the accent around the camera and dimple.

Second, I thought the 5.7"" screen was going to be too big for me, but I was wrong. I tried handling the Nexus 6, which was the closest thing I could find comparable in size, but the X Pure fits perfectly in my hand. I've had to use my old original X for a couple things recently, and it feels weirdly tiny now.

As for storage goes, I upgraded from 8 GB on my old phone to 16 GB here (along with a 128 GB microSD card) and my new phone was already having problems with lack of storage space, so I've had to make sure to keep moving apps over to the SD card. But that will be solved with Marshmallow being released.

You can hear the sound cracking at high volumes or even during calls and it can get very annoying. I also noticed that on my unit, the power and volume rockers seems to be a bit on the loose side. You can feel where the buttons move around inside the the phone. Other than that everything runs like a breeze.

For starters, I am not tech savvy. Before this phone I had the Nexus 6, but I ran into a string of problems. My first Nexus 6 was fine but after getting it replaced the phone kept getting too hot (108 F), especially the screen. My fingers would burn every now and then and that was my cue to put it down. My poor Nexus 6 got stolen, so I ended up buying this phone.

MIC
What bothers me about this phone is the mic quality. It is slightly better than the Nexus 6, but people still cannot hear me. I have a soft voice, but if my lips are almost touching the mic and people are still complaining that I'm not loud enough then this phone needs to get its priority straight. For that I am taking off one star. Furthermore when setting up my special phrase for Moto Voice I ended up putting my mouth to the phone when it told me not to. My phone could not hear me.

However, after finishing the set up, Moto Voice responded when I called to it from across the room... what gives?

TEMPERATURE
Earlier I complained that the Nexus 6 at 108 F burned to the touch. This phone gets up to 110 F and yet I can hold the phone without my fingers getting burned. I do think the rubber back somehow helps or maybe Motorola designed this phone better (well it is new). I'm just glad I am not getting burned anymore.

BATTERY LIFE
I want to say the Nexus 6 battery life is longer than this phone because I can go up to 8 hours on one charge. What I do on my phone is text, browse the web, YouTube, Netflix, play music, use the maps app (30 minutes a day) all while my location, Bluetooth, and data is on. That phone was never resting unless I was eating or showering (Hmm maybe that's why it got so hot).

The Moto X Pure has about 6.5 hours of battery doing the same activities I've mention above. However, I did read that because of the way it is built the battery life will be around 6. Therefore, I can't complain since that is how it is. I do feel the battery drains faster than the nexus 6 when playing music and using the navigation at the same time, I suggest to leave it plugged into your car.

CHARGING
Do charge this phone when it is at 10%. Because it will take an hour to charge. For some reason when I charge at 70% the phone takes about 1 hour and 50 minutes. I am not sure why, but I learned to wait until the battery gets really low. Also, don't even think about using a regular charger. That will take ages. And invest in a good car charger because my battery life stayed the same when I was using navigation or playing music.

SPEAKERS
Like the other comments, the speakers are louder than usual. I feel the audio is too loud when the volume is near zero. I haven't run into a problem with the top speaker yet.

MOTO APP (Has nothing to do with my rating. This is an observation since I am new to Motorola)
This is for anyone who is new to using the MOTO app. The phone is designed around it. If you turn Moto Display the phone the phone will light up when your hands get near. The whole point is to save on battery life so that your phone does not accidentally turn on when it is inside your pocket or bag. With the bumper case attached, the power button will not be accidentally pushed. I like it and have it on all the time.

Next is Moto Voice, just like ""Ok Google"" Motorola has it's own voice command. I don't have it on anymore because when I play YouTube or Music on the phone, the thing always activate. I am not sure why but it seems to do it at random because when I play back the audio of when the voice command pops up the phone doesn't react. It can unlock your phone when you use it which I thought was useful at first but then annoying if my phone unlocks if I am playing audio. Hopefully this gets improved. For now, I am fine with Google's voice command.

The others are boring and not something that I would rave to anyone about. There is a ""Chop twice for flashlight"" (I guess this is useful if you don't want to unlock your phone and click on the flashlight button), ""Lift for Moto Voice"" (this still needs working on. You place the phone to your ear and Moto Voice comes up. I have this turned off), and ""twice for quick capture"" (I have this on but I don't use it because I'm afraid I might accidentally fling my phone across the room).

I guess these features are nice if you want to be discrete about certain things. But again, not a necessity. Some of these features do need improvements though.

BUMPER CASE
Yes, it does come with one. It's made out of plastic and easy to put on and take off if you follow directions.

FINAL THOUGHTS
I only had this phone for about two and a half weeks. If I run into a problem or have more thinks to say, I will edit this. The reason why I rated it three stars is because of the mic. If I am going to spend $500 on a phone the mic needs to pick up my voice. In addition, a three star rating means I would not buy this phone again nor would I recommend it to anyone because there is nothing new. It is an okay phone. If anyone is on the fence about getting a new phone, wait until the new Nexus 5 and 6 2016 comes out (I apologize for not knowing their exact names). Maybe those will be better. This is not a ""OMG I NEED THIS NOW"" phone. However, please note that I am an average phone user and perhaps do not know this phone's full potential.

What I look for in a phone is storage, RAM, and the ability to disable useless apps. I do appreciate being able to open multiple apps at once without the phone freezing or the app crashing. Never had I have this happened to me on this phone.","3.0 out of 5 stars"

And I am not talking about its size. Well, sure, it's 5.7"", but it is super grippy (I have the rubber version) and because of the dimple and its form I can easily hold it. Even one handed use for typing is not  a problem for me. Now, I think I have big hands. But still.
The phone fits in my jeans, which is good too. Does not feel that big at all.

The speakers are SUPERB and reach the levels of an iPad air 2. Good basses too, which a nexus 6p lacks for example.

The screen is really good too. Nothing I can complain about. Everything looks just great on the 1440p.

The camera... It does not have IOS, but the digital stabilization does a very good job. So video no problem. Also, 4K recording works, though a  little laggy. Also, it seems a bit grainier than 1080p! 1080p is enough, anyways. So no big deal.
Front facing flash? It's REALLY good. And much nicer than Apples solution with flashing the screen for a moment. Looks much more natural.

Performance is very, very smooth. All works well. The snapdragon 808 does a great job. The phone does get high while downloading a lot or intensive apps, but not too hot either.

Fast charging is great too. It's very fast!:)

The build is premium. No protruding camera, metal rails, well shaped, glossy front panel.

Overall, just a great phone. Especially for its price. 64GB was 544 euro. Unbeatable.","5.0 out of 5 stars"

I purchased the 32 GB edition for $349, so overall, it was a decent deal. My review will briefly cover overall performance, battery life, connectivity, camera, and value.

Performance: it's very quick even though it doesn't have the latest Qualcomm chipset, but the 3GB of RAM definitely helps. I have not experienced any lag at all, and I have zero complaints. I didn't do any benchmarks, as those are readily available with a simple online search, but to be fair, I don't play a lot of games. I have played video at 1080 with no problems, and the screen is quite nice as well. The screen is definitely a step up from my Lumia 640, but I can't really see the difference between it and my old Samsung S4. I suppose some people play games and there are faster chipsets available, but for me, it's almost perfect on the performance level. The near-stock Marshmallow experience has been amazing, and even the Moto apps are usable, especially the twist Camera feature. Unfortunately, there is no fingerprint scanner, which I would have liked. 10/10

Battery Life: I usually unplug the phone in the morning at 6:30am and plug it back in at 11:30pm, which is about 17 hours. However, I am not allowed to use my phone at work, so even though it's on, the screen is rarely used, resulting in 70% battery life remaining at the end of the day. That's pretty good, but again, if you are a constant user, I expect it to be much, much lower. Also, the TurboCharge feature is awesome since I can charge my phone quickly. The downside is that not all QuickCharge chargers seem to work with it. I'm not sure what that's about since it's Qualcomm-licensed technology. For reference, my Lumia 640 (low-res screen) used to lose 15% in the same amount of time and usage. 7/10

Connectivity: I looked at all the available unlocked devices with minimal bloat and CDMA/GSM connectivity. I have not tried CDMA networks, but on T-Mobile, it's mediocre. I was supposed to receive LTE Band 12 with the Marshmallow update, but it never connects to a B12 antenna. The Lumia 640 had B12, and it was phenomenal. I am only getting a B4 LTE connection, which is mediocre due to T-Mobile's blah network. I am looking to switch to AT&T with the hopes that B17 LTE will be up in my area. Motorola antennas are known for being quite good, and I don't really have a reference to go from, so I'll concur for now. I know it's probably a T-Mobile issue at this point. I do have issues with Bluetooth in my car, as it will fail to connect some times, causing me to go through the whole ""forget, unpair, and re-pair device"" process. It has happened twice in a month, so that's not great. Wi-fi performance has been fantastic - it usually has a faster connection than my iPad and Chromebook. 6/10

Camera: I mainly switched from my Lumia 640 to this because of the camera. So far, it's pretty good, but I actually prefer the camera on my Samsung S4. The Moto XPE's camera does not have any modes for situations like Action. That means a lot of blurry shots. If everything is still, it's great. Maybe I can find an app to fix that, but for now, it's not very impressive. 5/10

Value: For $349, it is a decent value so far. If it stays operational for 2 years, I'll be happy since I don't have to be on a contract and I can switch from CDMA to GSM whenever I want. The annoying Bluetooth connection losses are my only major qualm, with the lack of a fingerprint scanner as a minor one. I just recently found out about the Blu Life One X, which I would have liked to try first, since it's only $150 (but only GSM unlocked). If Band 12 LTE ever works for T-Mobile, I would probably go from ""liking"" this phone to ""loving"" this phone. Right now, I'd give it 6/10 overall.","3.0 out of 5 stars"

It was then stuck in a boot loop.  After troubleshooting and doing a factory reset Motorola offered to either do a standard return with a 5 day eta, or I could let them charge my card full retail and expect a 4 day eta.  I returned it to Amazon since it was still within 30 days of purchase.  Amazon did miss their delivery date of the original order due to ""order processing.""

Finding TurboPower 25 chargers locally was a bust, but as always - Amazon to the rescue.  Same with screen protectors and cases.

I upgraded the phone to Android 6.0 Marshmallow upon first unboxing it (over WiFi). The Moto X Pure was provisioned easily at a Verizon Wireless corporate store (for no charge).  They even put on my screen protector.

Call sound quality on the phone was excellent.

My previous device, an original HTC Incredible, ran 2.3 Gingerbread.  I was still adapting to the Marshmallow experience and larger screen before the phone stopped working.  I had yet to unlock the bootloader, so AFAIK I was unable to try loading a new software image since my guess is that the problem was just software related. My only option was to send it in.

I appreciated being able to buy a contract free phone not limited to any one carrier.  I think the Moto X Pure is a good phone with lots of potential.  However I am going to try something else as a replacement.","3.0 out of 5 stars"

The camera lens was VERY dirty and actually a little difficult to clean off. Also, the phone and contents were very dusty. Power supply was just thrown into the box dusty and dirty not wrapped up. Tons of micro scratches on the screen and 1-2 deep scratches.

So all of this, I can clean up no problem, the main reason why I am in the process of returning the phone is what happened when I turned on the phone. There is a pretty large white pressure spot on the screen. Very noticeable. I was hoping it would go away in a few hours, unfortunately, that is not the case.

Had it replaced once already, and can have it replaced again, but I have seen enough. I had a good screen protector and case on it, and I have never broken a phone before this and have owned at least 3 different smartphones.
The edge to edge glass means that if it falls on one of those edges, chances are the impact will crack the screen beyond belief.
I will be moving unto something else as much as I love this phone. My phone will fall. It's just the reality, but they are always small drops.

"","","I originally had a Moto X 2nd generation and it was a great phone. I decided to try out the Moto X Pure and I have been extremely disappointed. In the 7 months of owning it, I have had volume issues, bluetooth issues, and now half the screen has faded to yellow from white. From day one I felt like it was a downgrade from my previous Moto X, not sure why as the hardware should be superior. On top of that I had purchased the Moto Care since they advertise they will send you a like new phone before you ship yours off for repair. They have since changed this option (6 months after I purchased) and will not honor what they sold me. Great customer service. I decided to get a prorated refund of the remaining ""Moto Care"" and will send off under the 1 year warranty. Obviously I have to find a back up phone first. Once I get the Moto X ""Pure"" repaired I will be selling it. Needless to say I believe this is my last Motorola product. If you search on line you will find the issues I stated as somewhat common. I highly recommend you look elsewhere for a phone, otherwise buyer beware. Motorola can change their policy as they see fit and at the expense of their customers.","1.0 out of 5 stars"

Its features leave me questioning why I ever locked myself into expensive contracts to get 'high end' phones.
Probably one of the best phones in the price range and just as good as phones which cost twice as much. Compared to my friend's S6 and my sister's Iphone 6 plus I would say this easily competes in every category I care about and at half the price.
My wife who is a photographer, prefers the camera on this phone over her Iphone5s for for the quick pictures where a high end camera is not needed.
The battery thus far tends to last about 2-3 days under moderate usage, a drastic improvement over my last phone which often wouldnt last even a day under light use.
The phone is very zippy for all applications I have used it for.
I purchased the 16 gb version and added SanDisk Extreme 64GB MicroSDXC UHS-1 Card with Adapter (SDSQXNE-064G-GN6MA). The OS allows you to use the card as embedded memory to store anything you want on the card as if it were internal memory.
I used to purchase new phones every 2 years on contract and usually I would be either dissatisfied with the service or the phone long before the contract is up. with high end phones often costing $600+ to replace and contracts expensive to break, I found myself often dissatisfied with the contract deal.  That mixed with the fact that I have noticed relatively few substantial improvements in the smart-phone industry over the last 4 years meant I saw no reason to continue with expensive networks to get 'the best phone'.

After debating over the Nexus 6P and the Moto X Pure for several weeks (as another excellent review breaks down in great detail) I decided on the MXP. After three months with the device, here's what I like so far:

* Price. After the Nexus 4, and prior to that a Trac phone (don't hate), I knew I wanted to stay on an unlocked device. I also needed a serious hardware upgrade (read: much better camera), but didn't want to wait for the 6P and fork over the extra dollars. For $400 plus tax and about $50 for a glass screen protector and 64GB micro SD card, I feel like I made out.

* A truly pure Android experience. After using Google Launcher on my Nexus 4, I knew I would never submit to bloated carrier-ware on a contract-bound phone — like, EVER. Motorola simply and decisively stays out of the way on their G and X products, only inserting themselves for some practical features that I find myself using daily (i.e., twisting the phone to open the camera, 'chopping' the phone to turn on and off the flashlight, saying 'Hey there, Moto X — play [song title]' while cooking or folding laundry). I'm a firm believer in their strategy to stick to the basics, and it makes for a clean and satisfying user experience.

* Screen size. This was something I was initially skeptical about, as I have small hands. I was so attracted to the clarity and contrast of the screen, however, that I couldn't resist. I find this phone remarkably easy to hold (the circular divot in the back guides finger placement), and would challenge those who are wary of phablet-style devices to give this a spin — I think you'll be pleasantly surprised.

* Picture quality. A big plus of the MXP is the 21 megapixel camera. There are plenty of reviews that break down how this camera stacks up against the iPhone 6 Plus and Nexus 6P, and it's clear each has their strong suit (the iPhone 6s Plus, for example, has lower megapixels but reportedly superior aperture). I've found the camera to be excellent in outdoor settings, specifically; photos are clear and lighting appears natural, if not slighter higher in contrast. Many reviewers take issue with the minimal camera interface, but I'll argue again that Motorola did this intentionally, hiding the features from view until you need them. Tapping anywhere on the screen (except the focus 'circle') takes a picture, as does squeezing anywhere on the volume buttons. You can also use your customized voice command (mine is 'Hey there, Moto X') to say 'Take a picture' or 'Take a selfie'. It's a elegant solution and a refreshing change for quickly taking high quality pictures without missing the moment.

* Front-facing speakers. Although I'm no sound expert and mostly listen to music through a bluetooth pairing feature in my car, sometimes you just need an impromptu kitchen dance break. For these important moments, the sound is better than any phone I've heard in recent house-party history. If you find yourself without a decent speaker system and want to share a song or YouTube video with someone 'like, right now', the sound carries with impressive clarity. Turn down for what.","4.0 out of 5 stars"

I was reluctant to switch after my old iPhone 5s finally bricked, to an Android device with such a large screen.  However, after using this phone, I doubt that I will ever go back to iOS or to the smaller size screen.  I do have some advise if you are switching from iOS to Android.  Turn off iMessage on your iPhone before switching the sim card to the new Android phone.  To do this I had to put my sim card in another iPhone to turn that setting off.  This can cause issues with text messages sent from iPhones, if iMessage is not turned off prior.  Other than that, all you have to do to activate this phone on AT&T is change out the sim card.  You can still import all of your contacts from your iClound account.  It just takes a few extra steps.  I actually ended up buying two of these phones, as my wife wanted to switch after she played around with my Moto X.

Buying unlocked phones is the way to go.  I can't believe what a terrible deal that AT&T next plan is.","5.0 out of 5 stars"

First, activation.  I love the fact that the phone will work with any carrier.  If one buys the phone direct from Motorola, one can pay $5 and get a carrier specific SIM card; SIM cards are apparently used for both CDMA carriers like Sprint and Verizon, as well as GSM carriers like ATT and T-Mobile.  You can then activate the phone yourself, at least on Sprint, which I use; this is what my son did.

If you buy the phone from Amazon, like I did, you need to get a SIM card on your own, Amazon doesn't seem to sell these.  You're supposed to be able to get a SIM card at a carrier store, for me my local Sprint-owned full service store.  I called my local store, twice, and was told this would not be an issue, I should just come on in.  I did, and of course it was an issue, the store personnel had a tough time finding a compatible SIM and activating my phone.  But finally they did.  Since the service model of buying a phone online from a third party like Amazon and then activating it with a carrier, at least a US CDMA carrier like Sprint or Verizon, is new, it's not surprising that many Sprint store personnel have technical problems.  Hopefully Sprint and Motorola will get the glitches out, and things will work more smoothly in the future.  SIM cards have been part of the process for GSM carriers for years, but are new to Sprint and Verizon.

The more important issue for me is that the Bluetooth on my phone does not work reliably, and is so far unusable.  I wish to use the phone with my car radio; Bluetooth worked perfectly between my car's Clarion radio and my old iPhone 4S.  Not so with my Moto X Pure.  I could get the phone to pair, and then to connect, but the connection was unreliable, and the phone wouldn't reconnect when I restarted the car, without a lot of futzing, as it should.  For sure my iPhone did.

I checked the owner forums on the Motorola web site, and a lot of Moto X Pure customers are having this and similar issues, both with Bluetooth enabled car radios, and with Bluetooth headsets.  These owners seem experienced with Android and technically savvy, and their devices worked well with other phones.  So, it appears there is a major problem with Bluetooth on this phone.  I put in a support request on the Motorola web site, but so far the responses are generic and do not seem helpful.

So, it remains to be seen whether or not  Motorola will solve this issue.  It's possible that I am doing something wrong - I'm new to android - but I don't think so.  If I get it working  I'll post here.  If not, I'll probably return the phone.

That's that bad news.  The phone is gorgeous, and for most things I have tried, seems to work well.  Generally, very fast, much faster (as expected) than the 3G iPhone 4S it is replacing.

But until I get the Bluetooth issue solved, I'm going to have to go with 2 stars.","2.0 out of 5 stars"
"","","The devices was decent.  Nice screen, snappy, decent camera and the latest Android OS.
I took excellent care of the phone, however, within a few months, I started having multiple issues.  Phone calls had so much static that I couldn't understand what the caller was saying half of the time.  Calls were fine when using bluetooth, but the not being able to hear out of the main ear piece presented problems.  The phone started dropping calls at random.  My previous phone never did this when using it in the same locations. The phone then started to get extremely hot, even when idle!  I could set it on my desk with no apps open, not charging, screen off, and it would become so hot it would almost burn my hand.  I could feel the heat coming through the TPU case.
When I finally contacted Motorola, things went from bad to a steaming pile of ****.  The customer service I received was so atrocious, that it alone says RUN AWAY!!  I could never check the status of my repair.  Calling them was a joke, as no one could ever give me a status on the repair.  It was constantly the repair team is gone or the system is having issues at the moment.  I finally got a shipping label emailed to me, but then never received my phone.  The tracking label status just stayed at ""created"".  This tells me the phone is still sitting at Motorola.  After calling (multiple times) they acknowledged that it was over their limit for turn around time, and I was promised that the device would be sent out and I would have it within 2 days.  Surprise, surprise... NO Phone.  So again I called, got disconnected and called back.  Run-around and run-around some more.  I had to demand a manager because they apparently do not know how to escalate issues.  They would rather feed you some line and get you off of the phone than to actually assist you.  Once I finally talked with a manager, the best they could tell me, without telling me, is that they lost my phone and have no clue where it is at.  Their solution is to have me order a new phone which will take 2.5 weeks to be delivered, and that isn't even for a custom design.  I have to ask myself, if I wouldn't have called (and called, and called) to the extent I did, how long would they have allowed me to go without a phone before acknowledging there was an issue?  Apparently being without one for over a month is fine in their eyes.  So unless you're someone that considers themselves lucky and will never need to utilize Motorola repair services, I would look elsewhere.  The headache is not worth it, trust me!","1.0 out of 5 stars"

At first I was a bit let down with the battery use but I quickly got over it because how fast it charges. But obviously the battery drained quickly with me because , I don't know about you but when I get I new phone I spend the majority of my time admiring and tinkering with it for the first few days. But now with regular use, I can get through a whole day, but just barely. I let it slide because of how fast it charges. The camera is great . obviously it won't compete with the likes of the galaxy phones but it can surprisingly hold its own against them. For me the camera is perfect, especially for just 400 $ you can't ask too much from the camera, but like I said the higher end phone cameras don't completely blow it out of the water. In a fair fight it would last a few rounds with those big guys ;) (galaxy s6 , note 5, lg g4, etc etc). As for the software, I'm loving the near stock is, its as smooth as butter, and I personally haven't encountered and slow down or stuttering, and it can play any game the app store can throw at it. The screen is gorgeous! That 2k screen amazing, obviously is not amoled like some higher end phones, but its still gorgeous none-the-less!! I'm blown away at the fact that you can get 2k resolutions on a 400$ phone . (besides some of the cheap Asian phones that don't get 4g in the united States, and sacrifice camera and build quality for it). Another great feature is the expandable storage! Something manufacturer's are leaving out in the hopes that you'll pony up more dough for larger internal storage. There is one thing that does bother me though, and that's the temperature this phone accumulates during extraneous use. It gets pretty hot, and that surprised me considering the snapdragon 808 processor was supposedly cooler than the 810. But I've had experience with both and they get to about the same temperature. Dont get me wrong, its not to the point where you cant hold it but it does get annoying and i do find my hands get a little sweaty after holding it for long periods of time. But it only happens if I use it while charging , play demanding games or am installing multiple applications. All in all , for the price, this phone is amazing. I challenge you to find a better deal for the same price. This is good enough to hang with the big boys but at only 3/4ths the cost. I definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a decently priced phone with good specs that won't empty out your wallet.","5.0 out of 5 stars"

First, I couldn't find any description of what's included anywhere (not even on Motorola's website). I even asked Motorola customer care and while they answered my question, they gave me wrong information. Here's what's in the box:
1. The Phone (obviously)
2. Turbo Charger
3. Sim ejection tool
4. Clear polycarbonate phone bumper
5. Quickstart guide and warranty information

The included Turbo Charger is a single piece. This means that there is no USB to disconnect to use the cable portion of the charger as a means to connect to your computer. If you need to connect your phone to your computer, you'll have to use a different cable.

Build Quality and Feel:
The phone really feels solid in my hands. I like the 5.7"" screen size, but I'm not fully used to it yet coming from a smaller 4.8"" screen. I'm sure after a few weeks I'll think my old phone is too small. This phone still fits in my front jeans pocket without problems and doesn't feel ""too big"" like I thought it might.

Hardware:
Still haven't had a chance to take too many pictures but the ones I have taken look awesome in medium to well-lit scenarios. Photos in low-light (as mentioned by others) aren't stellar. Mine were blurry (despite holding as still as possible) and had low detail. This one shortfall of the camera is something I can deal with. Otherwise, the hardware is snappy and very responsive. Using AnTuTu benchmark I scored 48598 in 32-bit mode. While not the highest score, I don't believe this is taking into account some other processes that Motorola offloads onto other engines making the actual Android experience snappier and quick. I am still conflicted on the location of the volume rocker. I like it now on the right side so that I can watch movies in landscape mode without accidentally touching the volume rocker, but as a creature of habit, I'm still used to it being on the left side of the phone. The power button has a nice texture that allows you to easily distinguish it from the volume rocker without looking.

Software:
About as pure of an Android experience as you can get without a Nexus device. Plenty of other review out there about that. I purchased the 32gb model and from the factory I have 24gb of free space. With all the apps and other cached data after a few days of use, I'm down to 18gb of available space. I feel that the 32gb version is essential unless you plan on storing all of your photos/videos on an SD card.

Odds/Ends:
Others have complained about the proximity sensors being on all the time and being able to see them in the dark. Yes, I can see them in the dark, but no they do not shine on the walls or ceiling. Even when I hold objects close to them, they are not ""projecting"" light. These sensors do not bother or annoy me and are extremely difficult to even detect. I haven't noticed any issues yet with the speakers at full volume as others mentioned.

Will update with more detail as I before more acquainted with the phone.","5.0 out of 5 stars"

I could write a huge, lengthy review about its specs and performance and how it compares to other phones. But you can easily check that information out for yourself on sites that do just that for you.

My smartphones to date have been the Droid X, Galaxy S3, HTC One (M8), and now this phone. Sometimes knowing this helps you get some perspective on what I'm used to.

Hands down my favorite phone was my HTC One. I loved the feel, the sound, the screen (quality and size). That said. this phone is quickly growing on me, though. It's super quick, I've never had it stutter. Network and WiFi signals are always coming through strong (I'm in a NY suburb outside of NYC on T-Mobile). Objectively, I'm giving this phone 5-stars because it performs exactly as I expected it to when I ordered it. I'm getting everything they've advertised so far. I've had no problems setting it up, no hardware or software glitches - nothing. I'll update this review if any of that changes, but until then assume it's working great.

Pros and cons are subjective, so they may not matter as much to you. My rating is not based on these factors.

Pros:
+Good sound
+Great screen
+Clean, stock Android
+Only a couple of lightweight, Moto apps that are helpful.
+ Seems like Android updates are quicker than most other manufacturers.
+ Expandable storage (which seems to be going the way of the dinosaur lately).

Cons:
- Seems like phones are getting bigger and bigger. This one is significantly larger than my HTC One M8, and that's without a case on it.
- If you want the very latest Android version as fast as you can get it, consider Nexus.
- No fingerprint/biometric access.
- Non-removable battery.","5.0 out of 5 stars"

Cool voice activation where the phones listens for your catch phrase, doesn't actually work. Shaking the phone to activate camera works 50% of the time.
The worst is calling customer service twice spending an hour on the phone each time and they tell you they will send you a replacement and you can send the phone back to them... for $25!  So they make money off of your phone not working.  Um, no thanks!","2.0 out of 5 stars"

- OS: As the name ""Pure Edition"" states, this phone comes with a clean version of Android without any bloatware.
- Bluetooth: I was able to get my Jabra BT2406 paired up with the device, and working in no time.
- Camera: As nice as they claim it is, has HDR so that's a plus.
- SIM: The phone came with a SIM ejector tool I was able to use for easily installing my card.
- Phone: The voice was crisp and clear, both through the phone and over my BT headset.

Cons:
- Video: Can't do more than 30fps at 1080p.
- Charging: Took roughly 90 minutes to get to a full charge (from 0% to 100%) but this was on the first charge, will update if better in the future.","4.0 out of 5 stars"

I liked the build quality, and I was even more impressed with the HTC One M8. The speakers were phenomenal, the design was solid and distinctive, and I felt that the Sense Android skin was the least intrusive at the time. After upgrading to Lollipop, though, the phone struggled and over time got progressively worse. I had skipped the M9 after the lukewarm upgrades, and hoped the A9 would be the next big thing. Unfortunately, it just seems like an iPhone clone, and a poor one at that. No more dual speakers, no new ideas in the design, it was just the end of the line for me. I figured that I should just go unlocked, but the new Nexus was simply too big and untested for me. That left Motorola, who I’ve had a number of people tell me had really improved their phones, and bonus! Had a dual speaker setup. I decided to pick up the Moto X Pure Edition.

Let’s start with the toughest metric to quantify, the experience of using the phone. So far, the MXPE has been a fantastic phone. It’s amazing how great it is to have the option not to install the standard carrier bloatware. The only carrier app I’ve installed is the hotspot, which means in my case I’ve shaved 16 useless apps off my list. Just on that basis alone this was a smart move, but that’s not the only massive improvement. The Moto actions are a great benefit, and while I’m not as all in on voice commands and letting the phone run my life as others may be the fact is I’m finding more utility from these features. The voice recognition seems better, the response is quicker, and in general it just seems more usable. Overall, I’m just enjoying using the phone. In the end, tech specs and marketing don’t matter, you have to like using the phone if it has any chance at success. For me, the MXPE passes with flying colors.

After experience, hardware and software come into play. It would have been great if the speakers on the MXPE could match what HTC had in their Boomsound hardware, but I knew going in that wouldn’t be the case. Still, the speakers are pretty good, and while they lack some of the HTC polish it’s nowhere near enough to balance out the other deficits. The overall sound quality is very good, the vibration is enough to notify me of an alert, and while I know there are better displays on other phones I’m very happy with the image quality of the MXPE. The camera takes great pictures, although like others I am still trying to adjust to the actual controls for it. They’re not terrible, but they are pretty unique so it’s a little more of a learning curve than in the past. The speed of the phone is great, no stuttering or sluggishness so far in using any apps. I was able to simply move my SIM from my M8 into this phone and was in service within 5 minutes, no calls to the carrier or configuration in the website, which is a first and a welcome change.

In summary, I’m very happy with what Motorola has produced here. On paper it may not be the most amazing phone in the world, but in my day to day use of the device I have no complaints. Whether you are looking to try Motorola as an alternative to what you have now like I was, or you just want a phone that’s enjoyable to use, the Moto X Pure Edition is an easy recommendation.","5.0 out of 5 stars"

I miss Android. I had about 25 different Android phones in the past 4 years. Not even kidding. I tried the iPhone 6s because I haven't had an iPhone since the iPhone 3g and wanted to try it out again. After deciding it's not for me, I did some research into some of the newer Android phones. My last phone was a LG G Flex 2, had a G3 before that. I was debating on getting the g4 since it's only about $400 on Amazon brand new. I had the HTC One M7 & M8 and loved the front facing speakers on them so I wanted to get something that had front facing speakers. After much research it was between the Moto X Pure and the Nexus 6. Obviously I chose the Moto X Pure and unfortunately it's going back for a few reasons.

I bought this from Amazon Warehouse. I've bought from them before and had both good and bad experiences. After chatting with a rep I decided to buy from the Warehouse and received it a couple of days later. The packaging was all there, and everything that was seen in unboxing videos were also in the package and everything seemed in good shape. It said there were marks on it but I didn't see it and I have an eye for seeing any imperfections.

I fired it up and put it on the quick charger because it was about 15% full. While using the quick charger and setting up the phone, it fully charged in about an hour. Of course it was incredibly hot on the back of the phone, most likely from all the inside components working simultaneously. Setup was easy, especially since I was used to Android to begin with. About an hour after I set everything up, the phone froze and reboot itself. I thought it was weird, because I don't remember any phone of mine freezing and restarting on it's own. Unfortunately that was not the last time it happened. I used the phone for a few days and it kept randomly rebooting itself. I personally did not root it, and I don't know if the person before me messed around with anything but it's unlike anything that has happened to me before.

The freezing and random reboots, along with Moto not releasing updates in a quickly fashion made me want to return it and I am returning it tomorrow. There's some other quirks. The battery is kind of terrible. After taking it off of a charge, it loses 1 % after about 10-15 minutes of not even using it. My old G3 had 100% battery for about 1.5 hours before it would lose 1 percent and that was with a battery that was well over a year old. The screen on this phone isn't that good either. For some reason I have a bad time typing on it. Never had that issue before. Even with the good specs it kind of lags.

I am going to order the Nexus 6P, and if that doesn't work out I'll return it get a G4, if that doesn't work, return it and get a G3 again with Kit Kat. That was one of my favorite phones of all time and I was able to root and add custom ROMS easily. Not necessarily looking to do that now, but tinkering with rooting and Xposed yields excellent results for both battery and performance.","3.0 out of 5 stars"

* The good
Near stock Android is great.
Feels very good in your hand. A little narrower than the Note 4, but feels quite a bit smaller.
Price is fantastic.

* The average
Camera is solid in good lighting. Pics look sharp in natural light. But not even close to cameras on Samsung or IPhones.

* Growth spots
Speakers get crackly too often. They peak too soon. If sound is low, you're ok. Turn it up and I hear that crackle.
You're kidding yourself to think your battery will make it through the day with moderate to heavy use. Battery is a significant letdown to me.
Camera interface is awful. No button, you just touch the screen. No touch to auto focus.
Screen is OK. When coming from AMOLED or a retina, you will see a difference. For me, it is comparable to watching a blu Ray and a DVD. Not terrible, but enough to where I could notice a difference.
The OS feels a little hesitant to me on numerous occasions, not as zippy as an unlocked, just out of the box phone should feel.

I so wanted to love this phone. I've been so hyped for it ever since the Moto X came out and couldn't possibly see myself not owning it for years. But actually having it in hand, using it, putting it through the daily rigors, I can absolutely,without hesitation, say that i am disappointed in this offering to the point of returning it. It feels like a step down to me from what I was on simultaneously, a Note 4 and am iPhone 5S.
If you buy this expecting true flagship phone status, be prepared to be let down. I'm not an electronics snob by any means, but this phone does have notable shortcomings that push it into mid-range territory, not along the lines of a high-build Samsung or an iPhone. If you view this as an above-average phone, and not a flagship, you'll be fine. But to expect a Samsung or  iPhone performance from a phone at half the cost is unreasonable.","3.0 out of 5 stars"

I ordered a 32GB Black and a 32GB White. The black one had absolutely no problem at all on T-Mobile's network. The first White one that I received had a bad radio--it would not reconnect to the new tower after travelling. It would say I have full signal, but when I try to go online or make a call, it will just not go through.  Fortunately, Amazon was able to replace it for me and now everything works as it should.

If you are buying this phone now, you will receive an Android 6.0 update.

The camera is very good for a $400 phone. It is not as good as a the Samsung S7 but I certainly would not be embarrassed to show it to other people.The battery life on this phone is incredible. For me, it will has at least 8 hours with about 40 minutes of web browsing with constant refreshing (I read manga/comics online), 10-20 minute of YouTube at 1080p, and moderately heavy texting. All of this is with adaptive brightness set to 50%.

The only downside to this phone is that you will only have a handful of accessories. You are not going to have much choices in case makers. I found only about 5 brand name companies that makes cases for this one: Incipio, SUPCASE, Diztronic, Casemate, Poetic, and Imak. So if you are one of those people that love to accessorize, then this phone is probably not for you.","5.0 out of 5 stars"

For reference, I am coming from an LG G2.  I really loved many features of the G2, such as the double tap to wake feature and the buttons on the back, and I was afraid to lose those features.  However, the G2 was just a nightmare phone from the beginning (and to make things worse, LG is a terrible company to work with and they have serious quality control issues).  I wish I could say it was an isolated issue, but my wife also has the G2 and has had similar persistent issues.  Anyway, it was time to move on, and I am so glad I did!

What I love about this phone:
• The Moto enhancements.  It’s crazy that just a few simple additions to Android could take the OS from good to great, but that’s exactly what Motorola has done!  I almost never have to push the power button to wake my phone because it just knows when I want to turn it on.  Good bye tap to wake – I don’t miss that feature at all because this is even better!  And how many times have you pushed the power button just to check the time on your phone?  All you have to do is look at the MXP and it’ll show you the time.  Very cool!  And then there’s the twist motion that pulls up the camera – genius and awesome!  It’s very fast and has made my phone that much more convenient to use as a camera.  I also love being able to turn on the flashlight with a chopping motion (though it’s not as reliable as the camera motion, but I may just need to re-calibrate the gyro sensors).  I never want to be without these features again!
• If you read reviews about the MXP’s camera, you’ll see many comments about how it’s not as good as Samsung or iPhone cameras and many will downplay the camera app on the MXP.  It may not be the very best camera out there, but it’s very good and I am happy with it!  I like it much better than the camera on my G2 (which was a camera that received a lot of good reviews and praise) – I got so many bad/pixelated photos with the G2’s native camera app that I never used it and downloaded a third party camera app.  With the MXP, I’m very happy with the camera app and have little use for a third party app now.  The MXP's camera loads very fast as well.  And, again, I love being able to twist to open the camera, which makes it possible to pull the phone out of your pocket, twist on your way up to position, and have the camera ready almost as soon as you are physically able to take a picture.  This is far superior to having to unlock your phone and tap on the camera icon, or even swipe the camera icon on the lock screen.  The most important thing with any camera is the ability to take great pictures, and as far as I'm concerned, this camera does just that.  Even in lower light situations, which many say this camera does poorly with, I find the pictures to be good.  It's also very capable with close up shots - I was testing the camera by taking pictures of my 3 year old daughter and she came and climbed right on top of me so that the camera was mere inches from her and it focused great considering the range and constant motion (both my daughter moving and me trying to keep the camera still despite being jostled by her practically tackling me).  And that was indoors with nothing more than light from a window.
• I’ve seen complaints that Moto Voice isn’t as fast or reliable as Google Now, but this has not been my experience.  The only issue I’ve had so far is that Moto Voice doesn’t work for very many things if I don’t have WiFi on (I don’t have data with my plan, so this issue really won't apply to very many people as most have a data plan), but I’m pretty sure I just don’t have something set up right on my phone because I think it’s supposed to be able to make calls with or without a data connection, and that’s the main thing that I haven’t been able to do.  Regardless, I like Moto Voice – I love being able to have a custom phrase; it’s fun and I was able to pick something easier to say than “OK Google” (there’s something about saying that phrase that just doesn’t roll off the tongue very easily).  Also, Moto Voice works whether your phone is awake or not.
• The customization is fun.  I never really cared before what the back of a phone looked like and never understood why everyone made such a big deal about how “premium” the back of a phone was.  You’re going to cover it up with a case anyway, so why does it matter?  Well, when you can make your phone match your style as you can with the MXP, it suddenly actually does matter.  For once in my life, the back of the phone is a big deal to me and I found myself immediately seeking out a clear case that will show it off.
• This is a “minor” thing, but a detail that I really appreciate and didn’t know about until I got the phone – the camera lens is recessed a little below the surface of the phone.  Every other phone I’ve owned had it flush with the back of the phone and it got finger print smudges on it and was more prone to getting scratched.  With the MXP, I don’t get finger print smudges and I worry less about scratches because it’s recessed, and that holds value to me.
• I love the screen size (I think I would actually like to go to a 6” screen with my next phone).
• Front facing speakers are something I’ve wanted for a long time, and I can now say that it truly is the way to go and I’m thrilled to finally have them.  And these speakers are good, to boot!
• The turbo charger is fast.
• Water repellent – for a little peace of mind.
• Pure Android – nothing added to bloat the system.
• Expandable memory.  With Marshmallow, this feature has reached new heights as you can add an SD card and have the phone adopt it as internal memory.  That means you can go with the base 16GB model and just buy an SD card to get however much memory you want for less than the cost to go up to a 32GB or 64GB model.

Nitpicks:
• I wish the battery had a larger capacity, but it’s sufficient for a day’s use (at least for now as a brand new phone – it could become an issue a year or two down the road as the battery loses capacity…).  If the battery was user replaceable, that would be an ok solution (not that I would actually carry around an extra battery, but I would like to be able to replace it when it starts losing capacity to go all day).
• I wish Moto Voice had more functionality without a data connection, or that I could figure out what I have wrong in my settings if that’s the issue.  I see no reason why I shouldn’t be able to get Moto Voice to make a call for me without a data connection.  But, this may just be a problem on my end and not actually a problem with Moto Voice.
• I didn’t like how big the icons were, but that was an easy fix by installing Nova Launcher.
• I can't tell the difference between QHD screens and 1080p.  From the research I’ve done, QHD apparently isn’t much more of a drain on the battery than a 1080p screen (contrary to popular belief and what I believed), but it does tax the battery a little more and I don’t see the value in it.  Also, from what I've read, while it doesn't make a very big difference in battery life, it does make a significant difference in all around performance of the device.  Whatever the case, I would rather they put a standard screen on there and put the investment toward a bigger battery capacity.  But, alas, QHD seems to be the new norm.
• I don’t get the dimple on the back - it does nothing for me.  I just keep thinking I’m touching the camera lens (you’d think coming from a G2 that wouldn’t be the case, but that was a different kind of feel than the dimple…).  But I know many people love the dimple and find it useful. *Edit: As I have continued using the phone and have gotten used to the dimple, I am finding that it does help a little, so it's not as useless as I originally thought.","5.0 out of 5 stars"

The bamboo looks really good and this stock design variation I think is the best design combo. I heard a lot of bad reviews with the free bumper that came. Personally I love it, I think it really goes well with the bamboo and the white front; as a matter of fact I think it looks better for some reason. My only regret is that I should gone for the 32 gb since lollipop takes almost 30% of the 16 gb capacity. But I think Ill have to go now for a quality microsd.

Cons: MOTO assist tho very great and useful I think needs to be a little more polished and honestly I think theres alot more potential applications than what is available at the moment. such offline moto assist for some of the voice commands.

I am coming from the Note 4 which had slightly better battery and took better pictures (once you got the app open). After the Lollipop update my Note 4 started to stutter and was never the same although stuttered less over time. The Moto X Pure Android experience is far superior to anything I've tried in terms of response and fluidity. Also the features that Motorola adds like the double twist to access the camera and the double chop to turn on the flashlight are incredible. I can capture pictures much faster and won't miss as many moments compared to the length of time it took to get to the Note 4 camera, to me this makes up for the slight difference in camera quality. Also I have heard a few people talk about the build quality not being up to par with other flagships. I completely disagree, coming from the Note 4 the black base model I purchased on Amazon feels sturdy and looks clean with the edge to edge display and no physical button. I also like the width compared to the Note 4 which is slightly narrower and easier to hold in the hand. Also the curve in the back when holding with one hand makes it easier to grip vs the Note 4. This would be the perfect phone if it had a camera on par with the Galaxy flagships and longer battery life, although quick charge is nice and the phone should last a day under normal use. For $399.99 this phone is a steal, especially compared to the cost of a iPhone or Galaxy device.

It does not work with t-mobile prepaid sim card. It says can not complete the call. Called T-mobile. I was told the IMEI of the phone is not valid and the phone itself is blocked. Further explained to me that it could be that the phone is not completely paid for. Contacted Amazon. I was told the best way is to call Moto. Called Moto I was told the best way is to call Amazon. Finally I decided the best way is to send the phone back to where it comes from. By the way to be fair I love the phone. It does everything perfectly except making a phone call.

Two months later: Amazon gracefully exchanged the phone for me. This time it is really unlocked and T-mobile prepaid card working fine!

But ... yesterday it started doing UNTHINKABLE things. First the text messaging keyboard does not pop up. Then I found out any app with an input at the bottom does not popup keyboard. Just as I was wondering what's going on, the phone started many apps one after another. One of the apps it opened was the camera. And it started taking pictures and I can not stop it!!! It then even turn the camera from back camera to front and shot my face! It then attached the picture and sent it through text message to a person in my contact! OMG!","1.0 out of 5 stars"

The phone features are fine, very little bloatware. But the hardware quality is poor given the price. After a month the headphone jack started giving me some trouble. While listening to music I would notice that the bass would go off, or the singer's voice. Very strange. I complained to Motorola and they sent me a new one (they charge your credit card for the replacement and then refund you when they receive the old one, which is great). No complains on customer service. The replacement worked fine for 6 months and now the headphone jack is giving me trouble again. If I move the cable too much the music app thinks it has been disconnected and the song pauses. Very frustrating.
On top of that my screen is now cracked. I droped it once. A couple of my friends have the same phone, and their screens are cracked too. I had a nexus 4(made by LG) before, which I dropped many times and it never cracked.
When you pay for an expensive phone you expect quality. This is not a quality phone, no matter how fancy the features are. I'm pretty sure I'll never risk buying Motorola phones again.","1.0 out of 5 stars"

Only minor gripe was no included earbuds.  Maybe I'm spoiled, but I can't remember the last time I bought a phone and it didn't throw in some mic/earbuds.

One of the best features is the front camera: 5 MP with Wide-Angle lens and flash, so you can take the best selfies. If you order it directly from Motorola online store you can personalize it (on-screen hello message, engrave your name on the back side of the phone, change colors and choose if you like soft grip, wood or letaher backcover) but it will take more than a week to deliver. Works with the following frequency bands:

- GSM/GPRS/EDGE (850, 900, 1800, 1900 MHz)
- UMTS/HSPA+ (850, 900, 1700 (AWS),1900, 2100 MHz)

- 4G LTE† (B1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 12, 13, 17, 25, 26, 38, 41)

In ECUADOR: Claro and CNT Mobile (LTE Band 4, 1700 MHz); Movistar (LTE Band 2, 1900 MHz), so it works fine here in Ecuador (already working in CNT Mobile).

Box Content:
-1 phone (obviously)
-1 pick to open SIM card slot.
-1 Wall charger (cable it is not removable, so you can nnot use it as data cable)

Yes! Doesn't ships with a data cable or earphones, so you must buy them separately.

The phone is big but it fits nicely in your hand and the silicone material is soft and smooth. I'm not sure what Motorola did to the silicone but I haven't gotten one stain on it or marks or fingerprints on it whatsoever. The battery life could be better but hey, I can get through a whole day with it without having to plug it in but I am not a real heavy gamer or user. The turbo charger that Motorola includes does what it is suppose to and it charges this phone quick. It charged from 30% to 100% in about 18 minutes. The bumper that came with it, is fine , nothing really special or bad about it, just your average bumper. The 808 in here is snappy and responsive. A tiny bit of lag every now and then but it is so miniscule that I really don't even think about it. I really haven't taken that many pictures with this camera but from  the pictures that I did take, the pictures look pretty good and clear. But I'm not really a camera expert so I couldn't really tell you the finer details. But all in all, fantastic phone for a great price .","5.0 out of 5 stars"

As a light user, I can barely get through a day without topping up.  It uses 3% battery during night when I left on the table when screen is off.  So the android system is still using power even if I set to sleep mode.

The screen itself also uses a lot battery power.  There is no need to use 2K screen for a phone with less than 6"" screen, 1080P would be more than enough.  The higher resolution screen uses more battery power.  A 5.2 inch 1080p with 3000 mAh would be better for moderate user.  With current screen, at least a 3600 mAh battery is needed.

The size of the phone is also on the too big side.  A 5.2 inch screen would be better for barely one hand use.

The front dual speakers is the main feature for me to buy this phone.

PROS
+ Quick Charge can charge the phone very quickly.  No need to sit by the wall plug
+ The phone is fast and snappy.  No lag and apps load quickly
+ Finally has an expandable micro SD slot for additional storage.  Don't get me started on other manufactures who are not including this only to have you spend more money on higher internal storage.
+  No bloat wear installed on the device
+  Quick updates due to the stock nature of the device.  Already on 6.0 marshmallow.
+  Best bang for the buck smartphone on the market at this time.
+  Unlocked to work on any GSM carrier including BYOD plans like Cricket and Straight Talk (Will save you a ton of money)

CONS
- Motorola decided to go with and IPS panel and abandon the AMOLED screen on the previous generation.  This results in a good screen but lacks the pop and inky blacks of its predecessor.
- The camera is good but is outshined by others, but at the cost of a much higher price

Overall the phone is the best price vs spec device on the market.  I just wish they would have kept the AMOLED display from the previous generation.","5.0 out of 5 stars"

Pros:
Great Price
Beautiful Screen (saturation and color gambit is perfect in my opinion..)
Beautiful Bamboo Back (THis is REAL woods and you can tell once you touch it for the first time. Astonishingly nice..!)
Loud, Clear Front Facing Speakers (Nicer than the speakers on my HTC One M7..so definitely an upgrade in my case)
SD Card Slot (Self explanatory..)
Quick Charging (Awesome, Awesome..Awesome..!!!)
The Motorola Features -- They're all simple, useful and seamless!
Clear Bumper Case Included --- I have no idea why clear bumper cases are not more popular. If you want to protect your phone a bit without covering up the beauty/design of the phone..the included bumper case is more than sufficient. I like it a lot!

Cons:
Phone is Large -- This phone is large. No way around that. I knew it was large..but since you cant see it in person..I was a bit shocked when I received it. After you get used to using two hands to control and the extra weight/bulkiness that it adds to pockets..you'll begin to appreciate the larger screen screen instead of seeing it as a burden..
Headset Sound -- The headset's sound is low and hard to hear. It's a real issue..but it's not one that presents itself unless you're having a conversation outside or in a noisy environment.
The Camera App -- The camera app's design is ugly and non-intuitive in my opinion. I hate it. Lack of manual controls..and is weird. BUT, it works..so I'll just have to get used to it.

Overall..I am VERY satisfied  with the phone. I think that the processor, the ram, the camera and the customization options make it a flagship and I hate that it's considered by some to be a upper mid-range phone.

Purchased it from Amazon..it arrived two days later and I walked into a Tmobile to activate it..and I havent looked back since..!

It's worth every penny, but I wish it came with a fingerprint sensor like the nexus and other phones have. Waiting for the Android Marshmallow update. The battery doesn't last me the whole day, so I have to be aware of the on-screen time. But it's a bargain, you can plug the turbo charger to boost the battery. I'm not a gammer so I don't have heating issues. The Camera is amazing, I like the 16mp widescreen shots taken in auto, its better than having a point and shoot imo. Haven't recorded 4k video, but the other features like slo-mo is good. The main reason why I bought this phone was for the pure Android experience. Motorola is known to deliver stock Android with a few helpful Moto apps. I like the assist functionality as it is accurate in reading my voice most of the times. The display is gorgeous but not helpful in direct sunlight. The call quality is good, had some minor hiccups with At&t though with a few call drops. WiFi sync is fast and webpages load faster. Love using Instagram on this phone, the pictures come larger than life with the on screen vivid display. And 16gb is more than enough because you can expand your memory. This is a huge upgrade coming from a Samsung s3 mini, because you don't see phones with decent specs and pricing.  This phone is definitely a 700$ smartphone killer.

What you get in the Moto X is what you've always gotten in the Moto X. Very well-done hardware. Performance unencumbered by useless software, and what customizations there are truly are useful. Moto X Pure Edition isn't a huge departure from last year. The camera's better, a good bit better, but even then it's not necessarily leaps and bounds better. But for a camera in a $400 smartphone? I'd take it any day of the week, especially given what most of us do with our pictures anyway. Facebook doesn't need perfect. It needs good enough, and it needs easy.

Performance of the new Moto X is more than adequate. It handles things as they should, and without heat concerns. ""All-day"" battery life depends on your day. It's mostly been good for me but not spectacular. However Quick Charge makes up for that, for me, anyway. The software stays out of the way.

The camera takes picture very fast. The picture come up nice when there are enough light. However, this is a different story when the picture is taken indoor where light condition is not optimal. The picture come out too warm and in general, blur. I have tested it side by side with S6 edge and the S6 crashed the Moto X in this condition.

The other bad is there is no hard key. I find it really annoying to tap on the screen to get the soft key appear.

The good:
This is the best phone I have ever hold in my hand. It just feel right. Although it is a 5.7"" phablet, I have no problem with 1 hand operating it. Sure, i still have to use my other hand to reach to the top of the opposite top corner, but i have no problem reaching the opposite edge with my thumb. I cannot do it on my Note 3, which is at 5.5"".

The speakers is simple amazing. It blow both of my Note 3 and S6 out of the water.","4.0 out of 5 stars"

I did a great deal of research into the newer iPhones but had real concerns about spending $650 - $850 for a phone (carriers offer no real discounts for their existing customers). So I started looking at Android devices. I had Android devices for my first 5 years of smart phone use, so I didn't think it would be a big deal to switch back. There are a lot of larger screen Android phones out there! Many cost about the same as the iPhones. I focused my search on the following features and functionalities:
- bright, high quality screen with good color accuracy of at least 5""
- decent battery life
- good camera
- good voice quality
- at least 32GB of memory (or expandable with a SD card)
- dual front firing stereo speakers
- integration with Outlook calendars and contacts
- reasonable price

I did a great deal of research, including Android forums, Consumer Reports, other blogs and articles and Youtube reviews. I chose the Moto X Pure Edition as it scored very well in almost all categories and was $100+ less than any current option.

I have used this phone for about 3 weeks.Here are my observations: The quad HD screen is bright and beautiful. The stereo speakers are great for watching videos or listening to music. The battery lasts me all day and then some. It charges really fast with the included rapid charger. The SD slot allows for expansion if I need it down the road. In good light and outdoors, the pictures are incredible. (Indoor low light pics are not the greatest). The call quality is exceptional, both in regular and speakphone mode. It syncs well with my car (though a little strangely at times). And I can actually receive and make phones in the office building I work in, something I was never able to with my iPhone. The near pure Android experience is great, along with the excellent Moto features.

I am still getting use to Android and am now at the point that I seldom have to think about how to do something. The phone is large and heavy - all 5.5""+ phones are. A slightly smaller phone, say 5"" to 5.2"", would be easier for me to handle, but others have told me I'd get used to this in a couple months. (My iPhone 5 was only 4"".) Was hoping there was an ""iTunes for Android"" app, but I have to convert my music using a different app. And lastly, I wish it would sync and integrate with Outlook calendar. I have decided to move to Google Calendar, which works flawlessly.

Price wise, this phone is very hard to beat. It was $100 less than the new Nexus 6P (seriously considered this phone) and still less than the new Nexus 5X (also seriously considered) with the ""deal of the day"" Amazon price. It was less than half the price of an iPhone 6 Plus or 6s Plus, and hundreds less than a Galaxy 6 or Note 5. Very happy with my purchase and the great ""deal of the day"" price on Amazon!","4.0 out of 5 stars"

I've never purchased an unlocked phone until now and I am so glad I did. There are no carrier apps trying in futility to replace  functionality of perfectly good native apps already included in Android. The entire user experience on this phone is exactly what I've expected but never received from every previous mobile I've owned. It's going to get an update to Android 6.0 and I won't have to wait for AT&T QA to approve all the patches Motorola will be pushing out after, since the updates go direct from Motorola to my phone without intervention from my carrier.

The nerd in me also likes that I can enable the developer mode in Android and with two taps have the bootloader unlocked like I'm an OEM. This saves a lot of time messing around trying to exploit the boot image to flash custom firmware on the phone.

The Moto app actually does add functionality to the device that I actually want to use. That is probably the first time I've ever been happy about a vendor or carrier app coming pre-installed on my phone.

Below are list of pros and cons after using it for 1 month.
Pro:
1. Fast device.  This is a flagship phone so it runs fast and it will handle any games you can throw at it.
2. Stock Android.  For people that doesn't like the bloatware the comes with the major brands, this is your next best choice (not 100% stock because of the Moto app but it is as close as it gets unless you are getting a Nexus phone).
3. Supports SDXC and reads exFat format, which means you can also choose a smaller storage version and get an 128GB or 64GB SD card to get the space needed.
4.Splash proof.  Note that this is NOT waterproof so a little water is fine but you should not submerge it under water.
5. Moto gesture. You can twist the phone twice to get the camera on, very nice.  For some reason, I couldn't get the chop chop flash light gesture option to work.
6. Android update.  You can upgrade to Android 6 immediately after you get your phone.  I been having some issues with some of the games that I played after the update so you might want to consider before upgrade.

Con:
1. I read a lot of reviews that says this device use Snapdragon 808 compare to Snapdragon 810 so it does not run as hot as some other flagship phones.  I have not tried other devices that use 810 processor but this device does run very hot when using Turbo Charge or run games for a period of time.
2. The 3000 amH battery runs out faster than my 3000 amH battery Sony Z Ultra, most likely due to the 2K screen.
3. Camera is decent with sufficient light but not very well under low light, quality is not bad but not as good as Sony or Samsung flagship phones (which you pay almost twice the price)
4. I didn't know this before but stock Android does not display battery % to you by default, you have to enable developer's mode and do some research to get it to display. (This is actually google's fault)
5. MTP data transfer.  This is my biggest complaint after the android 6.0 version update.  You CANNOT change the default USB connection type from just charging to anything else.  I think most people that connect their phone to PC will want MTP instead of power charge and an option to choose default connection type would be nice.  Again, this is more of google and not the phone's problem.
6. Not USB Type-C.  If you want the newest USB connector, you will have to go with Nexus or wait until 2016 new phones release.","4.0 out of 5 stars"

It offers the stock android experience, without any carrier bloat, and is unlocked for all GSM carriers and will work on Sprint and Verizon with the proper SIM cards.

I am very pleased with my purchase. I will echo all other reviews here regarding construction, design, practicality, speed, camera, etc.

However, there are some things you should take into account before making this purchase that have not been address on other reviews.

First is Motorola's (Lenovo) update policy.  As a general rule, Google and carriers commit themselves to offering 18-24 month software updates of their phones. Motorola commits itself to ""at least 1 upgrade"" in that period. This means that you shouldn't be surprised if this phone gets Android 6.0 Marshmallow and that's it. Related to this issue, LTE Band 12 for those that use T-Mobile is disabled and the Stagefright 2.0 bug fix has not been incorporated into this phone so you have to wait for a future update.

Second is battery life. It is possible to achieve around 4.5hrs of on-screen time with decent standby times with moderate use, but only if you disable a lot of apps, specially Moto Display, Moto Voice, etc. Because of their always on feature and this phone using an LCD over AMOLED display, the native Motorola apps drain about an extra 20% battery life compared to them being off.

Last is third party accesories support. Compared to other devices, this phone doesn't have a lot of options regarding cases and screen protectors. So, it might be a bit difficult to find the right accessory for you.

All in all, this phone is an excellent purchase for the money and, if seen as a top mid range device, will keep you satisfied for as long as you have it.","4.0 out of 5 stars"

I went the Amazon route to get the phone quicker.  This is my first white phone.  The bamboo back is quite nice but unfortunately is covered with the holster I bought.

Last night I could have gotten 6 hours of screen on time with this phone.  I had 5 hours and 30 minutes of screen time with 21% of my battery left when I went to bed.  I am not a gamer and not a heavy user.  My average day is some text messages, a few phone calls and checking some forums and news sites.  I always have plenty of juice before bedtime.

The QC 2.0 quick charge funcion is great.  You can easily top this phone off if you do run low.  A 10-15 minute charge will add a few hours of time to the phone.  I bought a TechMatte backup charger for a cruise we recently went on.  It did a great job of quick charging this phone.  I really like this feature.  Be prepared for the phone to run hot when you first use the quick charger.  The battery has to settle in for a few days to get good battery life.  Mine took 5-6 days then leveled out.  I only use the quick charger for quick charges.  I use a regular charger to slow charge my battery overnight.

This phone is unlocked and will run on all major carriers.  Motorola is testing for band 12 approval with T-Mobile so don't expect it to work initially.  New updates should fix this once it is approved.  I'm on Verizon, so I am not affected by this.

Are their better phones on the market?  Yes there are.  Are there better phones at this price point?  No there isn't.  For the price this phone is a great buy.

Many manufacturers are doing away with external sd card storage.  Not Motorola.  You can add up to a 128Gb micro sd card to store tons of music and videos.  This is a must since all the cell phone carriers are charging ludicrous amounts for data.  Save yourself some data money and store your own music.

Edit:  I left out the fact of the excellent reception you get with Motorola phones.  This was a big reason I went back to Motorola.  I live in a bad cell area but can always get a signal when people owning Samsung's cannot.  You cannot beat the reception on Motorola phones. :End Edit","5.0 out of 5 stars"

Battery life is decent. I think it could be a bit better, but the fact that you can charge the phone to 100% so quickly with the turbo-charger makes up for any shortcomings.

All in all, it was a great upgrade from a Galaxy S4. The price is competitive and I like the fact that it is unlocked. I am on AT&T and signal has been perfect. Call quality is good.

Phone calls:

After using the phone for about 3 days, I have noticed that there is static in the ear speaker when on a phone call. The other person sounds loud and the call is clear apart from the light background static. Obviously, this is pretty annoying and really shouldn't be a problem with a $400 cell phone at this point. I will have to test further to see if the problem persists. However, I researched it and there have been reports of this happening so it's not just mine. The speakers however are good.

Screen:

The screen on this phone is YELLOW. It looks like everything has a stupid Instagram filter on it. (It doesn't get any better when changing the settings.) Yeah, it's that bad and definitely noticeable even without putting another phone next to it. I don't know if I can deal with that. Also, the minimum brightness of the screen is very bright which is harsh if you read on your phone before going to sleep. Even with an app like Lux which allows for negative screen brightness, it is still very bright and the on screen buttons stay brighter than the rest of it. It does work better for outside viewing however...better than the S4 or Oneplus One. On the subject of on screen buttons, the configuration from left to right is ""back, home, recent apps"". This really should be customizable.

Battery:

Battery life is pretty poor. The Quad HD display is crisp and easy to look at, but the viewing angles aren't great and it eats through the battery super fast. I'm hoping that Android Marshmallow will help with the battery life by allowing the ability to disable apps from running in the background. This has definitely helped with the Oneplus One battery life with CM privacy manager. Another thing to mention is that the phone gets very warm (116 degrees F) when performing simple tasks such as browsing news articles and checking email.

Charger:
The charger that Motorola provides does not come as a charging brick with a separate cable. So, if you want a longer cable, you have to use/buy another charger and cable. Using the provided charger when you want to use your phone at the same time is a pain anyway because the phone gets super hot and your hand will be sweating trying to use it.

Active display:

I find the wave hand over notification screen very annoying. Of course, due to ambient light changes or movements anywhere near the phone, the notification screen comes on. And if you have to pick your hand up and wave at your phone, you might as well pick up your phone. Not to mention that unless you're looking at the phone directly above it (assuming it's sitting on at table), it's extremely hard to see anything due to the phone having an LCD instead of AMOLED display. I would much prefer a notification LED.

Actions:

The double twist for the camera app and double chop for flashlight are beyond convenient and a real asset to the phone.

Speed:

The latest phone I have to measure against would be the Oneplus One. The Moto X Pure is only very slightly faster than the One and if measured purely on that, would not be worth the upgrade. The benefit of not ever having to deal with Oneplus again, IS worth the upgrade.

I will be testing the phone to see if some of the issues improve and if not, it will likely be going back.","3.0 out of 5 stars"

The included turbo charger is a great bonus for when you need to get a quick charge.

If you are not in need of fingerprint or you do not like it, this phone has EVERYTHING you need and some more. It is the closest Google stock Nexus-like experience. If you check out some reviews on youtube you will see all recommending this phone.

UPDATE: Returned the phone... while I like the design, performance was heavily impacted by non-optimized 6.0 software update which caused this phone to heavily underperform, and have choppy transitions like my old phones from years ago.

The Note 4 cost me $750 after tax last year, while the Moto X cost me about $300 less!  I love the fact that I can finally buy a phone that's NOT from Verizon, and have peace of mind knowing that if I ever leave, I can bring the Moto X with me to any carrier.  It's amazing booting up a phone with absolutley NO Verizon software!  All I had to do was use a sim cutter on my micro sim from my Note 4 and pop it in the Moto X...it connected to the network immediately.

Only issue I had was I wasn't getting simultaneous voice and data.  Every time I made a call, LTE would drop.  So I looked into it, and found out that you have to have Verizon activate Advanced Calling (HD Voice) on the phone on their end.  Then, you have to go into the hidden phone menu by dialing *#*#4636#*#*, then go to ""Phone Information,"" scroll down and toggle ""Turn on VOLTE provisioned flag.""  After you do this, reboot your phone, and now you've got simultaneous talk/data!

Other than that, the phone does tend to run a bit warm, but after seeing many reports of this phone running warm, it's just something with the processor/gpu I believe.  No, I don't have a faulty unit which is what everybody seems to run to the second you mention a warm phone...it's just how the phone is.  Both of my S3's ran warm, my S4 and my DNA.  Even my G2.  Even my Note 4 would run warm in certain circumstances, but the Note definitely runs cooler than this.  Who knows why, but it's not that bothersome.

The speakers sound great.  I love it.  Many people will complain of a ""popping"" noise after the notification sound plays, and then suggest you return the phone....DO NOT listen to these people.  The popping sound is the software/amplifier shutting off.  You will notice this on low end PC soundcards as well.  It's nothing you can do, it's not a hardware problem, and it MAY be able to be fixed with software updates, who knows.  But it's not something you should return the phone over, because every one does it..other phones do it, too.  We just never notice it because the speakers aren't on the front.

Battery life is going to be a bit meh on this phone.  My Note 4 gets some pretty awful battery life lately, and this Moto X will get me about the same it seems.  Nothing I can do about it until I root it and maybe install Greenify, but until then, the battery seems like it'll maybe get me my usual 15 or so hours off charger at 2 to 3 SOT.  We'll see.","5.0 out of 5 stars"

First off, The Moto X Pure is a well built phone.  The buttons feel nice, the phone has a nice weight, and it doesn't feel overly huge.  I'm not a large guy (5'9, 180lbs.) and I have no issues using this phone with one hand.  The screen is EXCELLENT, especially compared to the G3.  The G3 matches the X's resolution, and since the G3 has a 5.5 inch screen compared to the X's 5.7, the G3 has slightly higher density.  Honestly though, comparing the 2 isn't even fair.  The X has much brighter colors that are prettier to look at without being overkill like most Samsung phones.  The G3 looks washed out next to the X.  For me, the SD card slot was the most important item I was looking for in my next phone, as a lot of manufacturers are going away from offering one.  That in my opinion is asinine.  I bought the 16gb X knowing that I was not limited to the internal memory.  I've only been using the phone for a few days, but I can say that battery life is to be expected.  It actually is going slightly better than my G3 was when I stopped using it.  Currently I've been unplugged for over 9 hours and I'm still at 66%.  Keep in mind I'm using it in a work environment at the moment so it has mostly been just pushing emails and the like, but I spent my lunch break playing with it.  Overall I am very pleased so far and will give updates in the future.  I'll list the pro's and con's below.

Pro's
-Screen is GREAT, best I've seen on a Motorola phone
-Battery life isn't bad so far.  If I can get through a day without stress I'm happy, because with my G3 that wasn't the case.  It charges real fast with a turbo charger anyway, and you can get 3rd party ones for 15 bucks on Amazon.  Look at the Anker model.
-The front speakers are LOUD and sound pretty awesome.  No more cupping my hand around the back of the phone.  (Sorry G3, no more reacharounds........)
-Build quality is nice and solid and the phone feels adequate but not cumbersome
-Stock Android is the way to go, and you won't get much more stock unless you get a Nexus.  Plus, the Moto apps aren't too bad.
-A clear plastic bumper comes with it.  You may not want to use it long term, but it's a nice addition until you decide if/what case you want.
-I don't know if it's just luck or what, but it seems to me that this phone is getting better WiFi and cell reception than I'm used to getting.  At work I have a cheap WiFi router that has a really short range, but it appears to be stronger using this phone.

Cons
-I like the texture on the back, but since it's rubber-ish/silicon-ish, it likes to pick up fingerprints.  If you don't wipe it down regularly it appears greasy.
-It would have been nice to see USB-C on this phone considering it has the turbo charging, but then again I'd have to buy more cables.  I guess I'm grasping at straws......
-It wasn't free?

-Build quality feels nice and solid","5.0 out of 5 stars"

The best thing is that the phone is also compatible with normal micro USB chargers as well. Special Turbo Charger (which is again micro USB) is required for quick charging. Turbo charge (25W) micro USB charger comes with the phone box.

Screen is very responsive. No lag. I thought 5'7 would be a large for me, but hasn't been a big issue because the screen is very friendly. Overall taking size and responsiveness into account I would rate screen 4/5.

What I disliked: I don't like the fact that the Airplane Mode option does not pop up on long pressing power button but instead comes in the pull down menu. I owned a Moto-X (Gen1) previously so switching from that habit is not easy.

Overall I feel it's a great phone, fair price! (Would rate between 4.5 - 5)","5.0 out of 5 stars"

Its no amoled display, but hey, you dont have to worry about burn-ins. However, the viewing angles are terrible. VERY BAD. Youll have to look directly at the phone for best viewing or turn off adaptive brightness and max the brightness if you want a better viewing angle . I came from the first gen moto x w/ a 720p amloed screen and you definitely get better saturation and supurb viewing angles. You can barely see moto display if its laying down on a table and view it from an angle in a bright room. However, this is quite an upgrade to a 1440p res screen. Its beautiful and I even have the color display set to normal instead of vibrant because I like my colors accurate. I got used to it, its fine.  Stereo speakers are very loud and clear. However some sound causes popping and the start and end of it. Ringtones and short sound effects will make the poping sound. Its weird.

  Camera is fantastic. Don't knock the camera because it cant shoot well in low light. All cameras have a challenge for low light. Thats why we have cameras with bigger sensors like DSLR and more expensive mirrorless cameras with lenses with a F1.8 or lower aperture to capture dark scenes. Shoot during the day or turn the flash on. Find the light to put your subject in the frame. Go buy a $3000 Sony A7R II mirrorless camera if you want to shoot in low light and pitch black. If theres plenty of light, your shots will rival that of more expensive cameras. One thing I wish motorola would do is give us more manual control over the camera. I dont like the fact that you can not do 1080p60 recording. Why not give us that option? The processor is more than capable since the LG G4 can do it. 4k recording is very cool! I never thought i'd ever have a phone to shoot 4k video for a little over $400. Anyway, Motorola, please give us more advanced options for the camera app. Keep the simple stuff, but have the advanced options available for us photographers as well. Im gonna emphasize this again..Please give us a 1080p60 frames per second video recording option. More information, more smooth, much better for capturing action shots and its just overall pleasing to look at. More camera options!

Youtube app no 720p60 no 1080p60 options? What? Huh? I dont know if thats an issue with a phone or YouTube, but I hope this gets addressed soon. Should've been no issues for that.. ( UPDATE: As of 10/23/2015 YouTube now supports 60fps for the phone.)

You can customize this phone on Motomaker to make it the phone you want. How cool is that? I love the bamboo back and white front. Thats unique and you can only get that from Motorola.

Im not complaining about battery life. Im always near a plug to use the included turbo charger, which is crazy fast. I'll have full charge within an hour. Nobody should complain about battery life. Nowadays you should have a 2.0 QC battery pack to take with you if you know you;re gunna be out an about, a  2.0 quick charger for the car. No excuses on why your battery should be dead by the end of the night. They're realatively cheap on amazon and go on sale all the time. Dont want to hassle with all that? Well, then go spend more money for the droid Turbo 2.

Aukey Quick Charge 2.0 10400mAh Portable External Battery didnt work at first, but now it does. Make sure you research on 3rd party external batteries that'll work with this phone.

  Expandable storage! I got a 64gig samsung sd card for $20 on Amazon and my 16gig model is now a beast for storage. Why in the world would you even get a 32+gig model? Marshmallow is comming and when it does, you can put everything on a SD card and itll work just the same.

  This phone is bang for your buck. It up there with the big boys. 5.7""  crystal clear display. 6-core processor 808 Snapdragon 808( phone does get a little warm!). Media heaven. Just work on the camera app more and you're golden, Motorola. Maybe next time give us an option in motomaker for a AMOLED screen. ram configurations, cpu, screen size. Thats the future, I think. Customize the phone not from the outside, but the inside as well.","4.0 out of 5 stars"

It's heavy and bulky.  At three months of use, I'm very worried about how rapidly this phone is wearing out.

It has all the LTE bands you need for multiple carriers and traveling.  While the phone is fast, there seems to be a bug in the CPU speed governor that makes it lag and stutter constantly during interaction.  No applications scroll or animate smoothly.  From the factory, the phone is loaded with all the Google shovelware and a few minimal standard Android apps.  Google Launcher and Music are awful apps that you'll need to replace.  Most of the other Google apps need to be disabled to reduce battery drain.  The screen is bright and clear but incredibly fragile.  It's curved glass doesn't fit protectors and a mere 24 inch drop onto dirt cracked the curved corner off my screen.  The rubber back starts looks worn quickly - your fingernail or a comb can cut it.  The cameras are excellent as long as there's bright light.  Photos are blotchy in moderate light and completely black in low light.  The front-facing stereo speakers are strong and clear.  While this phone does have a notification LED, Moto won't let you use it.  You must use ""Moto Display"" which flashes the screen when there's a notification or nearby motion.  Overall, Moto Display has been a buggy hassle of flashing in the car,  not flashing when there's a notification, or killing the battery because the screen gets stuck on.  Battery life is 24 to 48 hours with light use and Google Apps disabled.  Heavy use leaves you with a dead battery by the end of the day, which may also result in you reaching the 300 charge lifespan of a LiPo battery in just one year.

Moto's warranty leaves much to be desired.  Screen cracks are $125 even if they seem to be from a manufacturing defect.  Having a replacement during the long mail-in service process costs $25 extra.  Many have reported Moto illegally refusing warranty services on rooted phones with unrelated manufacturing defects (usually a stuck volume rocker).  The back cover and battery is glued in.","2.0 out of 5 stars"

Google...Google..Google. They are becoming intrusive. I have decided to root to get rid of them. Google search banner stuck at top of every window pane, no way to remove.

Get the 32GB. I only have 24GB of storage left after system allocation. The 16GB has ~11GB avail after system allocation. This is typical as the manufacturer allows additional room for updates/improvements in operating system and wants to make sure there's enough later on.","5.0 out of 5 stars"

Well, 5 stars!! The display is beautiful, quad HD goodness with accurate colors at that. Another thing is the wonderful screen to body ratio on this phone, the side bezels are very thin (and the top/bottom ones are also relatively thin) making this 5.7 inch monster way smaller than what I was expecting when I took it out of the box (Good job Motorola).

The software was one of the main reasons I got this phone, near stock is beautiful performance wise. With 3 GB of RAM this phone does not lag in what ever situation I find myself using it. Plus updates will hopefully come fairly quickly. I replaced the default Google now launcher (which is by no means bad) with Action launcher so I could have a nice uniform icon pack. Also,the included moto features are very helpful, I use the motion gestures quite a bit especially to get into the camera and turn on the flash light. Attentive display is also a nice moto assist feature that helps me manage my notifications.

The overall build quality is nice, the back is not slippery (and I absolutely love the feel) and the contour helps with balancing this baby in your palms. I was initially worried when I saw 11.1mm thickness (and actually screamed lol) but I decided to trust the description that it was contoured and true to their claims it really has a wonderfully natural overall grip. I use no case and no screen protector (that's just how I use my phones although I am extremely careful with them) so the included bumper just sits in the cupboard. The bumper itself is a bit flimsy and hard to put on but I tried it a couple of times and it did just fine.

The cameras are above average especially in decent lighting conditions. The rear camera takes beautiful pictures and records surprisingly stabilized videos too. I don't take pictures too often so they both serve me well. The front flash works well too, it doesn't turn the entire picture white nor does it blind you when you use it at night. The 5 MP pics from it are also wonderful ESPECIALLY IN DAYLIGHT. They come out crisp with a lot of details.

The battery is average I guess, it lasts for about a day with average use but the best part has to be the quick charging. Boy, the first time I thought the phone was just playing with me when it said 20 mins left to full charge when I put it on the charger (at 65% or so) haha. It's just superb, it completely makes anyone ignore the average battery life, in less than an our, I usually always have a full battery.

For $399, this is about the best you can get.","5.0 out of 5 stars"

I went Moto-Maker on this (Ebony Wood - 64GB - white front and gold frame) although my 1st choice was natural leather - I just didn't like this year's natural option (especially with white front).  It came out looking awesome! I am pretty happy with the build quality from Motorola.

The screen is pretty bright and vibrant enough, although i am not such a big fan of the whole backlight lighting up with the Moto Display (pretty annoying in the dark).  The camera is pretty decent in medium-low light settings and awesome in the natural daylight (probably one of the best).  The 4K recording is great feature too - especially with an external SD card capability.

Performance is also pretty great.  I haven't noticed any lag so far.  All transitions are pretty smooth. I am a pretty heavy user (2-3 hours of screen time every day).  The phone lasts the entire day, although i am yet to travel with this so I will reserve the final words once I have traveled with this.  The 25W charger was a huge surprise - although i am pretty disappointed that i could not find one anywhere else as the performance is pretty phenomenal - my phone goes from <10% to 100% in ~60 minutes.

The software additions are the best features of Motorola phone in the last 2-3 years and i really cannot imagine Android with bloatwares - whether from Carrier or OEMs. This is truly how Google envisioned Android and their reasons for continuing with the Nexus series.

Overall, I am super happy that I got this phone.  I'll try to add more bulk to this review later as I've used it for 2-3 months.","5.0 out of 5 stars"

Was waiting for Motorola to provide a steep Thanksgiving discount, which did not happen unfortunately, though understandably, given the device was already a very good value for money at $450. Nevertheless, Amazon provided a $50 rebate for a limited time around Thanskgiving, which was enticing enough for me to make the purchase.

To be honest, I am **more than really glad** that I bought the Moto X Pure. It is really snappy with stock Android, has very good camera, features a beautiful and ergonomic design, and most importantly, I enjoy the very smart software that Motorola embeds in its phones, which makes using the Moto X Pure a very enjoyable experience (Note: I formerly owned two generations of Moto G and was already very impressed with Moto G, except for the camera). And, I am comparing this against my wife's iPhone 6S Plus, which we bought at the same time. IMHO, the strength of Moto X Pure vs. IPhone 6S Plus is not only in the price tag (which was roughly 50% of a full-price iPhone 6S Plus), but the very smart and human-centric software that makes using the device enjoyable. Moto X Pure also has better ergonomics than an iPhone 6S Plus, easier to hold due to the rounded back panel that fits better in one's palm.

In terms of the camera, which was *the feature that worried me the most before making the purchase and given Motorola's previous poor track record in its phone cameras, an iPhone 6S Plus's camera is still better than a Moto X Pure's camera, especially in low-light conditions. Nevertheless, in bright conditions they are comparable and you can't really tell the difference unless you are an amateur (which I am) or a professional photographer who are used to a DSLR or SLR. Anyway, if you are shooting in low light using a phone camera, using a flash is always a good idea unless it is not an option.

Overall, an EXCELLENT, BEAUTIFUL, and really SMART product! I hope Motorola keeps up with the outstanding work in making exceptional cell phones available to the masses (from Moto E, to Moto G, to Moto X)!","5.0 out of 5 stars"

I also own a Moto G phone and it's clear that Motorola really knows how to deliver great value in their phones.

The good:
- Good value, hundreds cheaper than most carriers flagship phones, but at least 90% as good.
- Works with any USA carrier, just plug in the SIM card and go. I'm using it with Verizon, just took the sim card out of my old phone and plugged it in and everything worked.
- Memory can be expanded up to 128GB more by plugging in a micro SD card (but you can't move apps to SD; it's just used for storage by certain apps including music, camera, etc. unless you assign the SD card to internal storage, which I tried on my Moto G and wasn't happy with; some storage hungry apps wouldn't use the additional SD memory).
- 99.9% pure version of Android with only minor tweaks that are actually useful (Moto display for showing notifications, and Moto actions motions to launch camera, light flashlight, etc.)
- No carrier bloatware either. Unless you've used an iPhone, with most previous Android phones you've no doubt experienced being stuck with multiple useless carrier apps that you can't get rid of. There's none of that on the Moto X Pure - there are hardly even any Motorola apps; I think just Moto for the cool notification and actions, and Connect for dealing with Moto accessories. Compare this to Samsung phones which are stuffed full of useless duplicative apps.
- Since no carrier is involved and Android isn't heavily customized, it gets updates faster than most other Android phones.
- Super-fast charging if you use the included adapter or any Qualcomm Quickcharge 2.0 adapter.
- Two front-facing speakers give good sound - for a phone anyway!
- It looks nice and is well put together. If you order direct and use Moto Maker you can customize the colors and materials; I did that and got the phone in about a week even though it shipped from China.
- Good performance, haven't experienced any lag or hiccups or crashes.

The less good (but nothing about this phone is bad):
- It's a little on the large side; if most new phones are too big for you, you'll think the same about this one.
- Metal body is a bit slippery on the edges; you will want a case to reduce the risk of dropping and/or dinging it (keep that in mind if you're thinking of doing a custom order thru Moto Maker; the case will hide the custom back panel unless you get a clear case - but a clear case just looks tacky to me).
- Battery life is so-so... considering the phone's size, it's too bad they couldn't cram in a bigger one. But the fast charging makes up for this by a fair amount. If you change location settings to battery saving that will also help significantly, but you'll need to switch to high accuracy (GPS) mode when using maps etc. - and then you'll need to remember to switch it back when you're done.
- Screen isn't AMOLED like many high end phones, so you won't get the blackest blacks or best contrast, but it's fine - and you aren't paying flagship phone prices.","5.0 out of 5 stars"

Anyhow, I bought this to use on Sprint to replace a recently burnt-out HTC M8.  Activating the phone, as others have cited, can be an bit of an issue unless you know exactly what you are doing.  For me, that meant asking Sprint for the SIM card to an HTC M9 (SIMGLW446C).  I had to do the activation in store because I am still on SERO Premium and it is not an easy process for unbranded phones.

The phone is quick, and I love the moto gestures.  Being able to turn on the camera instantly to capture something is priceless.  Moto voice is very useful in the car for playing songs on the fly via youtube, and I love that the phone is always listening.  The screen is big and beautiful, and the phone charges from empty in under 45 minutes with the included 25W charger.  Needless to say, I am hooked on the moto-branded features, and I cant imagine moving to a phone without them.  Reception works fine, and the AC wireless has no problem picking up a 600mbps linkup to my Netgear router.  The SD card support is a major boon, and I have pictures and recordings save to it automatically. Front facing speakers are very loud and wonderful for watching even in a crowded room, although they sound a bit biased to the tweeter side of the spectrum vs my previous boomsound speakers. The phone was ready to download marshmallow automatically when I booted it up.

Now to the phones issues; the battery does not last long for a 2015 vintage phone...I use the phone for my business, and phone calls/google calendar/gmail are my main apps.  At the gym, I use it to watch my slingbox over wifi or stream from netflix/crunchyroll.  The phone will last a solid day...but it will not last through the night.  On wifi, I get about 5 hours of streaming.  I hope this metric helps out some.  The phone will also occasionally get hot, and I have no clue what it is doing.  Typically it is after I use navi for a while.  This didnt happen with my M8, nor does it happen with my cheapo LG Volt on Ringplus.  I lose HD Voice to other sprint callers, and voicemail is a COMPLETE PAIN to setup, because visual voicemail only works for Sprint on Sprint-branded phones.  Even sideloading the APK didnt help.  Google voice handles those duties now, but it is not without its bugs (the web interface has random ""an error has occurred"" messages).  I dont count lack of a fingerprint reader as an issue, as I knew I was going to go without that.

Moto's telephone support is horrendus, and I recommend that you bypass their accidental protection for something like Mobile Rhino or SquareTrade.  The former is one of the few (Besides Asurion) which will cover for loss.

I have used this phone for around two months now.  All in all, it a great budget phablet.  It does take time to be used to such a big screen with my hand gestures (my palms are fat, so my the fleshy part under my thumb often touches something on the screen unintentionally).  If you can get at least a 32 gig for $300 or less, in May 2016, then I would consider this worthwhile versus its 2016 counterparts.","4.0 out of 5 stars"

The kind of fall (less than 3ft on soft carpet and with a good case) that, in my experience other phones can easily resist. The phone broke with a very thin, almost perfect line across the display (about 2in from the top). No problem, you can barely see the crack.... Wrong, phone was completely unusable as the bottom part (3/4s of the display) and where the menu controls are stopped working.
I have no way to demonstrate this, and there is a chance that I was incredibly unlucky with the fall, but something does not add up.

But forget about the broken display. You can say it was just me. Fine. But the real problem with this phone is the very high cost for replacing the display (for the many times people will truly drop it). It will cost you $199 to replace it with Motorola. Compared with $100 for the iPhone 6 at Apple. That is just too high, so please account for this in your calculations, when you decide this phone has a good price.

I just got the phone 2 days ago. I'm coming from a Note 3 which I tried and was running custom touchwiz ROMs two weeks of owning it. Last six months I have been running Cyanogen. I can't go back to non stock. Now I love love the camera on Samsung best hands down. However after a taste of the optimization, fluidity, and speed of stock I was hunt for a stock phone with good camera. This Moto X Pure camera is just as good in daylight. Night time with flash could be better if they program lens to let in more light out open longer. Night shots with flash are just as detailed if not more than Note 3 but it isn't as bright as Samsung. Like I said this can be fixed I believe with some software optimization. Multitasking is better than my Note 3. Still pacing battery life but turbo charging is nice very clutch. Still amazed with the multitasking. I have bamboo back and it isn't slippery which I thought it would be. Very nice and premium feeling. I couldn't notice any weight difference with my Note 3 which has a glass screen protector. The bumper it came with seems flimsy but it is pretty solid once it is on. Once you figure out how to put it on it is pretty easy. Hint phone goes in from the back on bumper. I was waiting for Huweai nexus but I decided customizability was bigger for me than having a ""Nexus"". Grip is better due to curved edge than Note 3 even though save screen size. Reception is much better. In my office where I had LTE but no bars I now have 2-3. I'm on T Mobile in Atlanta area. Speakers are nice caught myself trying to cup it like I used to do and I lol'ed because this is front facing. I thought having on screen button would duck since real estate is taken up but in fact disappears when you need it to. Have to get used to button layout. I prefer having volume on other side but I can survive lol. Front camera is good with flash and surprisingly it isn't blinding week not to my eyes. Maybe light sensitive ppl will have a problem. It did run warm like first 30-45 min when I got the phone due to downloading 94 apps and me trying to do everything I could on it. After that no problem. Liking the motto display. Not new to it I had so called dynamic notification. Screen wise amoled v LCD. They are both great. Moto has more pixel so seems sharper. It is warmer in time than Note.

It feels really sturdy and runs fast.  I have an LG G4 which is a phone that has largely the same hardware specs.  This phone feels much faster, which is a testament to how much a manufacturer skin done wrong can bog Android down.  The rubberized back feels wonderful.  I don't really want to put a case on this thing because of how nice it feels.  Battery life is not outstanding but acceptable. I can get through a day of medium to heavy use by the skin of my teeth.

There are two things I want to point out though that people should be aware of before they pull the trigger.  These are the two things I wished I knew before buying.

1) This is not an AMOLED display. Previous Moto X phones all had AMOLED displays.  This allowed Motorola's ""Active display"" notification feature to keep the majority of the screen off when notifications come through and pop up on the phone.  This is an LCD panel, so the entire display lights up for Active Display notifications.  It sort of ruins the experience for me and I'm not sure why Motorola made this decision.

2) There seems to be some kind of issue with the Moto X Pure's top speaker.  I'm not sure if it's all of the units or just a bad batch.  If you get one of the bad units, you will probably notice a lot of distortion coming from the top speaker when playing music/videos/podcasts at or near maximum volume. It is bad enough that I don't even want to listen to anything on my phone because it's just irritating.  There are posts on both XDA and Motorola's official forums discussing this problem.  Motorola doesn't seem sure if this is a hardware or software problem, but even Motorola's engineers notice this problem on their own devices.

Once this second problem is worked out, this will be a solid 4 or 4.5 phone.  Until then, I would be very hesitant to buy unless you're willing to gamble.  Good luck!  I will be keeping an eye on it and returning the phone if the issue isn't resolved by the end of my return eligibility window.

Update about the speaker issues:  I've had a chance to test FOUR Moto X Pure units and all four have a top speaker that clips where the bottom doesn't seem to nearly as often.  This problem is still present in the Marshmallow update, so I'm thinking more and more this is a widespread hardware problem.","3.0 out of 5 stars"

I tell you, it is a night and day difference for the better. Subjectively, this phone is easier to hold, has a better screen, and fits in police uniform shirt pocket (most of the time thats a deal breaker for me if it doesnt fit).

I am a phone guy. I had iPhone before because it was all carrier compatible. I left Verizon and decided since they are so nasty and scandalous to their customers, that I was done with carriers and phone contracts.

I use this phone on Cricket GSM (AT&T) and have zero issues. It has the CDMA bands for if later I go to PagePlus on Verizon network,  all GSM for T-Mobile, etc. Its multi carrier compatibility and the fact that its a Motorola were the biggest selling points for me.

If you have any questions please leave me a comment and I will try to help.","4.0 out of 5 stars"

HOWEVER!

Motorola repair services leave much to be desired. I broke my screen at the end of December 2015. I used the Moto-Care Accident Protection\Advance Exchange program where you pay a fee to have them send you a replacement phone and then you send in your broken one. Had a replacement phone by the end of the next week, however it would not work with my AT&T sim card. Got a new sim card from AT&T just in case the old one was damaged. Spent a couple of hours in the AT&T store and on the phone with Motorola tech support. No joy.

Motorola tells me to send that phone back for a replacement.  This time I do not use the Advance Exchange program because I don't want to pay the extra money to rush the phone to me, as paying extra for the first defective replacement phone was superfluous. I get a second replacement phone a couple of weeks later, after I send the first replacement phone back. That phone will not work with my AT&T sim card either. Spend hours troubleshooting this phone with Motorola tech support inside the AT&T store. The sim card is not the problem, replaced it again, and the replacement sim card works in three other phones there.

I finally determine that the GSM radio is turned off! I don't know how a phone is supposed to be ""All Carrier"" if the GSM radio is turned off and cannot function on AT&T.

Anyway, Motorola tech support(Tier 3) tells me there is no way for me to turn the GSM radio back on, and I need to send this phone in for repairs and that ""things have changed"" in regards to the repair facility, and that this time they'll get it right.

So I send my SECOND replacement phone in; they receive the phone on 1 March 2016(RMA 160219-005532). On 22 March 2016 I call to find out what is going on because I haven't gotten a shipping notice and the status of the repair is ""closed"" on the repair tracker.  They cannot even find my phone in the system based on the RMA, other to say that it's resolved/closed.  In that case, then why hasn't it been shipped to me? I finally have to give them my IMEI/MEID Number, to find it properly in the system. I find out that they are out of stock (of the phone or possibly the parts or something) and hopefully, maybe they may be able to ship it me sometime next week. They generated a new RMA(160323-005176) in the system, and the phone that they already had at the repair facility since 1 March 2016 has ""arrived"" on 24 March 2016. Today is 31 March 2016, still no phone

Currently this phone is in Open status.  I have no idea when this will be repaired/replaced. After not having my ~$600 phone(with customization and Moto-Care; which I paid in full - it is not subsidized) for over 3 Months, I may not have the phone for a few more months, as I'm about leave for some Army training in three days.","1.0 out of 5 stars"

2-24-2016, Revision B - Update 2...

Please make sure to read my original review's, below...
Owned for three months...

Generally its better than all phones that came before it...

Software updated: 6.0.0:
Battery slightly better, though sometimes does not make it through one day with moderate use.
Camera software updated, somewhat better.
Over all is much better...

My biggest problem is:  Google/ Android OS...
The problem is when there is a problem, there is no one to talk to.  There are forums, but there is no one responsible. There is no, Google Customer support or Google store - Unlike Apple ***
I cant seem to make Google Contacts sync, 100% of my contacts (all contact, is selected and Sync is functioning).  Sometimes contacts disappear from my phone, but are fine on Google Contacts (were I cant see them on my phone, only a PC).  I have had this problem with several phones.  Its a Google and Android problems.  The problem is, Verizon and Motorola, both say its not their problem, and to reset the phone to factory settings. This has never fixed the problem.  Or they say to delete your contacts on the phone and your Google account on the phone, this too does not work.  Some times the contact, disappears totally???
The only fix is to make a new contact with a slightly different name (just renaming does not work), I have to, cut-n-paste the all info over to the new contact.  The weird part is, often this same person (contact) will disappear month later???  Some people, have been re-added 3-6 times???

***  I would switch to Apple, if I already did not like Apple. Cant stand Apple.  So, I'm stuck, with this junky software...

 Update 1...
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
11-15-2015, Revision A
Please make sure to read my original review below...
Owned for two weeks...

--  Battery life is better than expected, way better than my new S5 that I just returned.  I can easily go through the hole day with one charge. Can go through several, if I'm careful (especially, if I'm able to plug in to a std car charger for my short commute).
--  Both BT and WiFi radios work good, once connected; but software controlling them, is not so good.  Pairing takes often several tries. Connecting via wifi, like pairing seems like there are rough edges (works sometimes, sometimes not).  I use Airplane-mode a lot (yes, I then have to turn on wifi), as I live in the woods (no cell coverage).  A couple times the wifi, totally forgot my passwords, and I had to reenter them?
--  The camera software sux.  Its made to be idiot proof. This makes it work badly.  When it takes good pictur, there very good...
I cant make it focus, the old tap the part of the picture, where you need it to focus, is now how to take the picture?  The zoom is idiotic. The camera software is absolutely horrible...

To summarize:
Overall, its very good.
The main problems is the phone software, was made to be too simple, it not easy to access the required functions, or even see which wifi your connected to, or that the BT-radio is in discovery-mode, things like this...
There are other issues that are likely Android related, already mentioned below (hopefully fixed in 6.0).

The Original Review...
--------------------------------------------------------------
10-28-2015, Revision A:

It OK....
I've had the phone for two days.
I got it directly from Motorola. It was shipped very fast...

The good:
--  The LCD is good enough. Clearly not as good as an AMOLED.
--  Fast and snappy, even after all the junk I add. Seems more consistent touch screen, like the user has priority (unlike my Razr Maxx HD).
--  The cell radio seems to work, way-way better, than the Samsung S5, I just returned...
--  Battery is OK, not grate.
--  Charger is fast.

Problems (Android 5.1.1):
--  Cant turn off, Google Now (a search-box on every screen), it takes up extra screen space. Older versions of 5.0 (and prior), had option to turn this nuisance off.  The effect is that this, 1-inch bigger display, cant hold the same info as 4.7 (Razr Maxx HD) or an 5.1 (S5), screen that could....
--  After getting Motorola support, see above issue (I think it was after them), there is a new keyboard of Hindo/ Hini.  And this version of 5.1.1, has removed, the ability to delete that keyboard!!!  Next, Google Play, started trying to up date my apps, for Hindo/ Hindi.  Gee, thanks Moto (very-unhappy sarcasm)...
--  The beginning set up screen, does not show up/ down selection of Languages, instead looked like I got the wrong country phone, this confused me at first...

The bad:
--  The metal ring I set for (I ordered) Mat/ Black, was more like brushed mat aluminum. And, I really like black trim....
--  Bluetooth, is finicky, is hard to make pair. And sometimes fails to connect there afterwards?
--  WiFi, fails to connect on its own, without manually, making it do this?","3.0 out of 5 stars"

I have to knock it down to 4 stars for ditching amoled for quad HD IPS screen. Don't get me wrong it's one of the best IPS screens out there especially for that size but I have to say I think the 1080p amoled screen on the 2nd gen is way better. Just hard to go from amoled back to LCD. They probably could've kept amoled display if they didn't have to make the screen so big. They've gotten too carried away with size. I don't mind that this size exists just wish they made a smaller moto pure for those who like a one handed experience.

Go figure right; lucky for me this is Amazon so I immediately purchased this one and start the return on the 16gb. Amazon is great and the phone is great, no problem with Verizon and it seems to get better signal than any other Verizon phone we have. The spec's to me look better than Nexus 5x, I figured this would be a fair comparison due to price and all network capabilities. If you have been in the market for unlocked type phones on Verizon/Sprint this will not disappoint as you might know CDMA is not very compatible with most unlocked phones.
There is no overlay on the android system, but the moto stuff is pretty good, it has a little more than stock Android. If you like all the bells and whistles you can always download go launcher, adw launcher or one of the 3d types that will put the fancy overlay on there for ya. And many of the carrier apps can be downloaded from play store as well, I use Verizon message app so I just downloaded it and it runs just fine on this non branded phone..","5.0 out of 5 stars"

I'm rocking marshmallow now and living all the features.

The moto features are cool but forewarning it kills the battery life, I turned them off and can get close to a full day of full use before needing charging.. The turbocharging on this phone is also light-years ahead of the Samsung Galaxy quick charge.. Phone does heat up during the ordeal but literally 10 mins gives me 40%..

Things I dislike:
There are no notification LEDs. How do I know when I have a message? I need to have my phone silent most of the time. A small flashing light would have been perfect. This VITAL function for me was never mentioned in any review I read. Seems standard on EVERY phone but this. Many people complain but idiots tell them ""use Moto voice to read you your messages"". Did I mention I had to be silent?

Moto Voice commands aren't working. It thinks my mic is in use. 24/7 since I got it. Right. Phone calls are fine, it's just the Moto apps. It worked for a few minutes but never let me set it up. Sitting in a silent room by myself, it kept saying my area was too noisy to set it up. What? It was quieter than a library!

Flashlight gesture? I had to download a flashlight app. Thanks for making it difficult.

Things I like:
I got 64gb onboard. That is useful. Also takes a sim card, which I hear other phones are getting rid of - which again - is not what I need. Not everyone can use the cloud. This is a business phone with sensitive data.

Got rid of a lot of bloat. Samsung kept shooting me TV messages despite the fact I don't even have cable. T-mobile would pester me non-stop. It's not there now. Of course, now I have other things to frustrate me.

In short, if I had to do it over again, I would not buy this phone.","2.0 out of 5 stars"

So much quicker and cleaner than my old HTC One X. The two drawbacks are exactly the same things you have all heard already. 1. This thing is HUGE. It definitely took some getting used to, but it is fine once you realize this is what phones look like now. Still fits comfortably in my jean pockets (non-skinny jeans, male) and I can do most everything on it with one hand still.

2. The camera does sub-par work in low light. I had read this and didnt really care, but it kind of sucks. The pictures in good light are AWESOME, so when you see what it takes in low light it really is a bummer.

Overall the phone is great, I just wanted to confirm that I noticed these two minor issues. I have no regrets on my purchase and I would recommend the phone to anyone who asked.","4.0 out of 5 stars"

I added 128 gig card for there is very little memory left with the 16 gig phone. The camera is very nice. I use it for my main picture taking now. The low light pictures are a hit or miss not sure why but seems that way in most peoples reviews of it. I can take one good picture then the next one a few seconds later is not very bright. I bought it for 299 and I think that is about right for the price. US Cellular had to put in their system as a Moto X gen 2 phone for some reason but it works great. The signal is almost as good as the 1st edition. My house is located in signal hell but I can still make calls with 1 to no bars. The speakers are great it makes a suitable streaming radio there is no FM with it. Call sound quality is superb and people can hear me better on speakerphone. Overall it is a nice phone I grabbed the 20 dollar extended warranty from the Motorola website for an extra year of repairs. The active display and shake to turn on camera and chop to turn on flashlight are great. I have used it in the pouring rain without worry that is a big win.

For me, this phone's improvements don't out weigh the negatives.  If you like a phablet, then this is perfect.  I love the better selfie camera, sd card, improved front camera and screen quality. The battery has not improved and is functioning on par with last years model.  The biggest negative for me personally is the size.  It is too big.  With the last model I could get away from needing a case, but with this one, it's so big trying to work with one hand, it will drop inevitably.

When you get your phone don't put your SIM card in. Sign into wifi and v shoo ask the setup stuff. Once you're to the home screen go to setting and check fit the update. Do the update and after it's finished do a hard reset (Google how to do it). Once that finishes and restarts it'll take you through the normal setup stuff again.I did that and I have had zero issues that other people have had.

As far a the phone goes, I absolutely love it so far. The one thing I waa worried about the most was using it in one hand since I don't have that big of hands. To reach the very top is a bit of a stretch that I won't make unless I absolutely need to because it feels a little risky, but the rest is as easy as my galaxy s5 was. This is phone is leaps and bounds better than the galaxy s5.

I seriously can't believe this phone is $250 less than my last phone. The build quality is so much better. I suggest buying it from Motorola (sorry Amazon, still love you guys) since you can customize it a bunch of different ways. They send it really quick to. I ordered on a Saturday and they gave me an expected delivery date of the next Monday, but it showed up four days later.","5.0 out of 5 stars"

Please read more before deciding against this phone for those issues.

I am coming from several years of Samsung Galaxy - S2, Note 2, & S5. Samsung lost me when they took away the micro SD slot. Some see those as archaic, but to each his own. I find them extremely convenient & versatile. I ordered my Moto X Pure directly from Motorola, so I could customize - white/silver front, turquoise back, metallic red accent. That was a hard decision. I have not updated to Android 6.0 Marshmallow, b/c the Moto Driving mode is taken away or changed. Supposedly 6.0 Marshmallow has that feature built in, but Moto's Driving mode works so well, & I use it so often, I refuse to lose it. I literally never have to touch my phone while driving. I answer & make calls, listen & reply to texts, start Google Play Music & YouTube videos all with my voice. I'll have to read some more reviews of Marshmallow 6.0 running on Moto X Pure before updating.

Speed - Nothing to complain about here. I don't notice any delays. It never freezes on me as was happening with my Samsung Galaxy S5 on a regular basis.

Front Speakers - Love these. Just makes sense. Sound comes through good & clear. Some have complained about rattle, & I notice this slightly, but I turn all the volume controls down just a few clicks, it solves the issue, & it's loud enough. Very easy to use the speakerphone. I never have complaints of background from the person on the other end. I also don't have background noise issues on my end, which was the situation with my S5 (oh the problems with the S5).

Included Case - The clear bumper is perfect for me. I've read reviews of it being flimsy & breaking quickly, but that hasn't been my experience. I like that my phone is protected (it's not going to get any edge & corner wear from dropping) YET the customization can still be seen.

Camera - I love that the camera lens is inset somewhat, so it is less likely to get scratched when setting down somewhere. Overall it takes great pictures - typical point & shoot quality as other smartphones. I don't notice any major improvement or decrease in quality coming from any of my Samsung Galaxy phones EXCEPT the front camera. It gets skin tone right & lets in a good amount of light. I don't like that face detection is not an option on this camera. I know I can use another camera app, but I really prefer to use the stock app. I guess I just like to see those boxes around the faces, so I know for certain the faces are getting priority on focus & exposure. I have tested using another app that has face detection & compared it to the pictures taken with the stock Moto app, & the pictures come out the same, so I have to assume the stock camera app is getting it right. Also, there is an option to control focus & exposure, but that only allows me to set focus on one face, so if I have all 3 of my kids in a picture, that doesn't solve the problem. Again, I do think the Moto camera app is doing it's job, I'm just very picky about my pictures. I use a DSLR for pictures I really care about. I think the person who uses their phone as their main camera will be happy with these pictures.

Screen Durability - I ordered a Tempered Glass screen protector, but sadly before I got it put on, I had a few TINY, BARELY NOTICEABLE scratches. I'm confused as to how they got there, b/c I was putting my phone in dedicated spots in my car & purse. They can't be seen unless I'm trying very hard to find them, so it's really not a big deal.

Battery Life -  I really don't know what to say here, b/c I'm not sure what's considered good battery life. It works for me. I unplug it in the morning, and it makes it until the evening with battery left, & I plug it in through the night. I'm not a heavy user. I'm a stay-at-home mom, & I occasionally throughout the day make calls, text, check email, make entries into a Google Drive spreadsheet, look up a recipe, read an article, listen to Google Play Music in the car, etc, but I don't spend all day on my phone. The charger is super fast. I haven't timed it, but after plugging it in with low battery & coming back to my phone, I'm always in shock as how much it has charged. It uses Qualcomm Quick Charge 2.0 technology. Sadly, there is no removable battery. While I have never had to swap out a battery, I don't think phone makers should take this option away. If a phone is dropped in water, it will be more likely to save the phone if the battery can immediately be pulled.

Antenna/Reception - I always loved my Motorola Razr flip phone from years ago. It had the best call quality & reception. Same with this Moto X Pure. I get reception in a metal building at our church where I never did with any of my Samsung Galaxy phones. I always had to walk out to make a call or use data.

WiFi Connection - There is an occasional problem with reconnecting to saved WiFi connections. Instead of it connecting automatically, it will struggle a little, & I just have to go in & click connect. For me, it's not worth complaining about.

If there's something I didn't cover, please feel free to ask questions, & I'll answer what I have experience with.","4.0 out of 5 stars"

The inboard storage capacity I went with was the 16gb version, mainly because I already have a 64gb micro SD card.

This phone reminds me of my Droid Maxx to an extent. I still enjoy how twisting your wrist twice will automatically bring up the camera, which I like to use often. I am not a professional when it comes to taking pictures, but if I were to grade it I would give it a solid B. In decent well lighten places that quality of the pictures is nice.  In darker conditions, it is not that well when compared to the LG G4. The camera focuses faster than my Droid Maxx, which is a plus.

The phone handles multitasking very well, but we all knew this already since all new phones handle multitasking pretty good.

The LCD screen is something I am not in favor of, but so far during the day, I have no problem viewing apps on my phone (Assuming you do not have your screen brightness all the way down).

The Battery life works for me. I get about a day's worth on from it which is perfectly fine since the turbo charging is quite convenient. From 0-100% it takes about 1hr 15mins for that full charge. Though, I don't let my phone go down to 0, I usually start charging around 30%, so under an hour you will easily have a full 100% charge.

I have never had a phone with two front speakers. This is a plus for me, it is easier to hear videos or songs now without having to raise the volume all the way up.

I have noticed some people seeing the red sensor at night. This is slightly true. I actually do not notice it. The only way I see this red sensor is if I really look for the red dots (one at the top right of the phone and the other at the bottom left of the phone). If you don't see them, just keep focusing in that area and you will see them, but I do not see this as a problem as it is something that is not noticeable at all unless you are purposely looking for the sensors.

I did not have a micro SIM card, so I went to Verizon and they gave me one. It took me awhile to switch phones as this was my first time. So everything else we smoothly. I must note, where you insert the SIM card, it is a dual slot for a micro SIM card and micro SD card. That way you don't accidentally have to open it a second time like I did.

The phone feels nice in the hand, for some people it may be big, but for the most part, it should be fine. I like how the back of the phone has a nice rubbery feel (I did not go with any of the premium back that were being offered through Moto Maker) and I have a better grip on the phone, so I do not see myself needing a case for it. There is the possibility of cracking the screen, but since I have warranty under Motorola, it will be automatically replaced as long as I pay a $50 deductible.

As for the cons, I did not see anything that I disliked from the phone.

I do not see any drawbacks to this phone. You really cannot go wrong with $400. Though, I do find it silly if you compare a budget phone to a premium phone as they are pertaining to different audiences and their price tags are no where near to each other.

Even though I did get the invitation for the OnePlus 2, I am happy I went with the Moto X Pure (Style). I highly recommend this phone for anyone who is seeking for a new, but budget phone.","5.0 out of 5 stars"

This phone is a joke, this company is a joke. DON'T BOTHER.

The Moto X Pure died twice on me. First time, a week in, it would not turn on. After weeks of back and forth with Motorola's customer service (a grueling experience), they finally sent me a ""refurbished"" replacement. A month in, the display on the replacement device went all wonky. Lines appeared on half of the screen and a white cast would pop up randomly. I sent it to Motorola for repair, and after the requisite weeks of BS from their staff, they refused to honor the warranty claim, citing ""internal physical abuse"". However, the phone was in perfect physical condition, not a scratch on the screen. The display was messed up and they couldn’t explain how I could have caused it, but still kept going on about “internal physical abuse” when it was clearly a manufacturing defect. They were extremely rude and unhelpful, and after three levels of escalation, the conclusion was that whatever the repair guy says goes.  They would not even give me the option to pay for a repair. They sent me back the broken phone as ""unrepairable"".

So after spending 400 dollars on the phone, plus nearly 50 dollars on accessories (Incipio case, tempered glass screen protector, etc), and so many hours of pointless argument with Motorola’s version of customer support, all I’ve got is a paperweight. Expensive lesson to learn, but I’m coming from a Galaxy S3 that lasted three solid years (and I never needed to contact Samsung, ever, over those three years and the phone still works great today, cracked screen and all), and let me tell you, the Moto X Pure is not worth it. There are so many great phones out there, do not bother with this one. I got myself a Nexus 6P and couldn’t be happier.","1.0 out of 5 stars"

I removed one star for Poor voice quality in one star for non-seamless wi-Fi integration.
I must say that the apps run superfast and without hesitation. the battery life it's only fair in comparison to my old phone but the turbo charger made up for it handsomely. The camera was superb. Press anywhere on the screen and you could take photos in rapid succession. If you stay within the same Wi-Fi area the Wi-Fi sometimes fades out annable actually if you want to rejoin.

Sadly, I cracked its screen, and even though I could fix it myself (I've done many phone repairs) I paid $130 to send it to Motorola for the original manufacturer parts and repair warranty. I figured I was paying for ease and covenience.

I was so wrong.

Almost two weeks passed without indication they had received my device. I called in a serious of support specialists before finally being forwarded to the escalation team, who took about 30 minutes to locate my phone, verify it had been received, and assue me that it would be sent back to me within 5 business days.

But that wasn't the end.

5 days later and no word from Motorola. I called again. Support informed me that, actually, they could not replace my Moto X. 'Replace' is the word they used. But wait - they are supposed to be repairing it, right? Wrong. Apparently they just send you a refurished edition of the same model. So they no longer had my original phone and could not even replace it with the same model.

The representative offered me an 'upgrade' to the Nexus 6, which I absolutely HATE. It was way too big for me (I am a woman with small hands) and they are apparently completely unable to provide a Moto X Pure, which is the closest thing to what I have now. Somehow, it's not in stock? How is MOTOROLA, the company who MAKES the Moto X Pure supposed to be 'out of stock'?

Anyway, they assured me the Nexus would ship in 5 business days. Here we are, 8 business days later, and STILL nothing. I called in at this point to demand a refund for all the inconvence, which I was informed they ""do not owe me"" because I agreed to receive a Nexus 6. Mind you, I agreed to a replacement for my LOST device - I did NOT agree that the replacement would be satisfactory compensation for all this grief and aggravation.

This has been absolutely, by FAR, the worst customer service experience I have ever suffered through. On top of everything described, each representative could barely speak English, was dismissive and rude with me, and clearly barely trained, just reading off a script. I cannot express how enough how disappointed I am given how much I enjoyed the original product.

At this point, I am only eager to receive my 'upgrade' to the Nexus 6 in order to promptly sell it, never buy anything Lenovo or Motorola again, and make it my life's mission to make sure everyone else knows how awful this company is, too.

In sum, stay away from Motorola; while they make a decent product, should anything go wrong, God forbid, they will not support you and determine instead to make your life miserable.","1.0 out of 5 stars"

I've been a loyal Motorola customer for the past 15 years, but here's why this will be the last Motorola phone I will ever purchase:
I received my Moto X Pure Edition 32GB back in January. The phone was defective out of the box. It was overheating and could not connect over WiFi. I sent the phone to Moto Care in Fort Worth hoping to receive a replacement phone soon.
That was my first mistake. I should have sent it back to Amazon for a full refund.
The first warning sign that something is wrong at Moto Care: I received an email notifying me that my phone has arrived, along with an RMA tracking number - yet no information was available online. In fact, 5 weeks later, there is still no information online regarding my phone. The online RMA Status form simply doesn't work. Motorola's response? ""Yes, we know."" So, I've been calling Moto Care weekly hoping for some good news. Each time, a customer service representative reads off the same script, in broken English: ""Sir, I am sorry to inform you that we are currently out of stock but we have moved you to the top of our priority list. We hope to have a new shipment arriving soon"".
Me: ""This is the fifth time I'm calling and each time, I was told exactly the same thing.""
Moto Care: ""Is there anything else I can do for you today, sir?""
I think to myself, wait, this can't be...I can order a new phone for $400 yet they don't have a phone in stock to replace my defective device?
Frustrated, I look deeper into the negative reviews here on Amazon - perhaps it's just me? Well, it isn't just me. Check the 1 & 2 star reviews and you'll quickly see that Motorola has a serious problem with their customer service/repair center that needs to be addressed.
Bottom line: Avoid the pain. I cannot recommend this phone.","1.0 out of 5 stars"

Motorola offers additional protection for 15 mos or 24 mos. CA residents get 30 days to try and return if there are issues.

I think it is an okay phone. Only 2 points I really love are that you can use it on any carrier and no bloatware.

IT GETS HOT and that freaks me out. When a phone gets so hot it is very likely that it exceeds the SAR rating, which I have NOT found a SAR for the Motorola X Pure Edition 2015. ***NO CONSISTENT SAR RATING LISTED***

It is not easy getting a really protective cover that fits b/c of the back curve.
The leather, wood etc are a joke b/c you need to be able to grip your phone.
It is not a cheap phone so you lose your gimmicky back stuff when you get a quality protective cover.
Don't waste your money on the bkkc cover gimmicks & put that extra cash into a quality phone protector/ cover.
Get the standard plastic back cover in your fave color choice, which is sort of grippy and get it engraved if you are 100% certain this is your phone for additional security i.e. proof it is your phone if you leave it somewhere.

The camera is on par with phones in this price point in my opinion. Some are better some are worse but overall it is a wash because compare to Samsung Galaxy S6 and Apple s6. There are wins for each camera phone in different situations when we took the exact same pics. Plus if then you zoom and you will see they don't all look the same.

You really don't want a phone that runs this hot around kids so it is making me lean towards returning it, along with the fact I don't enjoy a large phone.","3.0 out of 5 stars"

With this new Moto X Pure Edition phone I have never had any issues with battery life.

This is the first phone in probably 4-5 years that I have been able to get through a day without having the dreaded 15 or worse 5% battery warning at the end of the day. The other selling point on this phone was the turbo charger that comes with it. Within 20 minutes I can usually have 30-40% battery life back.

Half of the screen is static, making the phone unusable for anything except answering a phone call.  I contacted Motorola through their warranty department on 3/16 and was told the only thing they could do was to put me in their Advance Exchange program, and they would send me a ""like-new"" phone that I would have in my hands in 4-5 business days, then I would send them my broken phone in return.  It's been 7 days and I still have no phone.  After another 30 minute call today, 3/23 that escalated to a supervisor and their ""Repair Escalation"" team, they admitted they don't even have a phone to send me, and aren't sure when they will have one.  I expressed my frustration at being promised a phone in 4-5 days and now being told they never even had a phone, and have no idea when I will get one, and they said there's nothing they can do.  They will not send me a different phone, they will not send me a brand new phone, they can't tell me when I will actually receive a refurbished phone, and they won't reverse the charges on my credit card for their Advance Exchange program. I'm self-employed, with this being my main form of communication for my business.  I expressed this to them, and they said there's nothing they can do.

So here's the thing - for the 3 weeks this phone worked, it was great.  But it broke, and Motorola has a terrible warranty program and are extremely frustrating to work with.  Unless you're prepared to deal with a situation like this, don't buy this phone.","1.0 out of 5 stars"

This was replacing a Moto X 2014, in a way. I had dropped my 2nd gen Moto X and shattered the screen, and have been using a Galaxy S4 until I could get the Moto X fixed with my crazy busy work  hours. Obviously this phone is light years ahead of the S4, and I like it better than the Moto X 2nd Gen, if for nothing but the screen size.

I've wanted a bigger phone for a while, and this one covers that base in spades. It's still small enough to fit in the pockets of the jeans I wear, and I can carry it comfortably.

Battery life does leave something to be desired, but it does at least come with a quick charger, which helps when I'm at home. Considering I pretty much have chargers available wherever I go, I've never been too concerned about battery life on any phone. At any rate, if your looking for a great phone at a decent price, and can handle a larger phone, you won't be disappointed.","5.0 out of 5 stars"

The USB 3.0 I loved so much burnt out and all replacements failed, so time to get a new phone...

After 3 weeks of researching every phone on the planet, I finally narrowed it down to the top three, another unlocked Note 3, the Moto X, and the LG G5.
The LG G5 had similar specs, but cost $200 more.
The Note 3 is a great phone, but I can't afford to get burned by the 3.0 USB port failing again.
MotoX winner.

Pro's
Fairly large battery(unremovable), I really wished it was a little bigger to make it through a 16 hour day of moderate use without needing a recharge, it will do a 12 hour day though, and the turbo charger is pretty fast charging the phone, it seems to vary though, sometimes it's 25 minutes to full, other times it's around 40 on the same charger and wall outlet....

The screen is large enough to make me not miss my Note, and the LCD screen is brighter, I read the active matrix isn't as good so it fades out when not looking directly at the screen, but it is a minimal shading difference, and I like the LCD display better the the super amoled, except for the lack of stylus function.(see cons)

Memory is 64gig ROM, and 3 gig of Ram, backed by a 808 Snap Dragon processor that can run anything to date, and I never had it lag out yet.

Camera is great, dual flash rear, and front facing flash is nice to for low light selfies to see if you got a booger in your nose at the bar...

Cons
Pure Android is nice for a smooth operating system, but the apps for the camera are low rent when compared to Samsung, the phone call screen is poorly laid out with undescript buttons, and the screen doesn't know when to shut off sometimes and you end up hitting a mystery mute button that can't be undone.

I tried using a stylus to write my signature on a PDF file, but the stylus doesn't register on the screen, and the picture editor is very basic, these are software issues that can be remedied with 3rd party software, so I still give it 5 stars for being a high end phone with a mid range price tag.","5.0 out of 5 stars"

1.  Material wise Motorola did a great job.  This phone has the fit and finish of any flagship and the display is absolutely beautiful.
2.  Audio quality from the speakers and headphone output are fantastic.
3.  The ability to use a micro SD card.

The downsides:
1.  Compared to the 2013 Nexus 5, this Moto X Pure 2015 has actual Geekbench 3 performance scores between 2750-2950.  The 2013 Nexus 5 is more consistent between 2600-2750.  Not much of a performance boost and at times I've noticed that this phone is ""laggy"" relative to the 2013 Nexus 5.
2.  It does get a bit warm in use, which isn't a big deal, but irritating.
3.  Phone call audio quality doesn't seem to be as good as expected since the speakers and headphone output are excellent.
4.  The camera, although scores high on DxO Mark, seems to have too much noise in low light and really suffers from not having image stabilization.  Also, don't use Motorola's camera app as it does not have geotagging.  Use Google's or some other camera app.
5.  Battery drains a bit too fast, but if you have a few phone calls and text messages, you can get through the work day.

Bottom line:
At this price point it would be worth looking at the Nexus 5X and perhaps the HTC One A9.  I would not upgrade to this phone if I had a 2013 Nexus 5 or Galaxy Note 4.","3.0 out of 5 stars"

I've read a lot of mixed reviews about the battery life, but in my experience, it doesn't cut it.

It's 3:30 now, and I've only used it for a little calling and texting and some light browsing, the battery is at 20%. That was with the brightness at about half. I don't have a lot of experience with Android, but all the iPhones I owned would have been still above 60-70% by now.

It may just be the cost of having all of those beautiful pixels to light up, but if this is the sort of battery performance to expect from hi-res devices, I'll go back to 1080 and below screens that can actually last. Either way, this phone is going back. Maybe I'll try one of the new nexus phones. If the battery on that isn't an improvement, I guess it's back to an expensive apple device.

OK, so this phone is Motorola’s flagship, but in the end, considering the current market, it’s a really really good midrange phone.

It does not feel nor looks totally premium, but it does not feel low end either. It has a good build quality and feels solid in my hands.

The OS runs smoothly and fast, nearly stock Android experience with few but powerful Motorola’s applications added.

The screen is no longer AMOLED, so Motorola’s Moto Display notification system is no longer “battery friendly” as all the screen lights up instead of only the required pixels. So if you came from a previous Moto X, you will notice that Moto Display’s black areas are not really black but faint grey. This is totally normal in LCD displays and is no issue, the screen actually looks really good without the grainy texture you can see in bright areas in AMOLEDs.

As to the camera, it really isn’t great as Motorola claims nor is it a huge disappointment as previous Moto Xs. It takes really good pictures in well lighten situations: sharp, correctly exposed, color balanced. But in low light situations it takes noticeably weak pictures, below premium phone cameras standards. On the other hand, Motorola’s camera application has a Night Mode that reduces the final size of the picture from 21 megapixels to 5 megapixels and works really well. Using this mode night pictures look sharp and low noise, with a grain that I actually like. Of course switching Night Mode on and off is far from ideal, but I think the decrease in the megapixel count in the final picture is an acceptable sacrifice for better low light pics as 5 megapixels seem about enough for everyday use.

Battery life is not great also, nor is bad. It’s actually close to Nexus 6 and you can go about 12 hours of intense use. Turbo charger is really fast, full charge in less than an hour, though it can really heat the phone up.

Finally, there is this thing with the infrared lights that I really dislike, to the point of thinking that maybe I have a defective unit. You see, Moto Display allows you to check notifications without even touching the phone by waving your hand over it. It’s a nice feature present in previous Moto Xs. It works with 3 infrared lights that reflect IR light on your hand for a sensor to detect your gesture and turn the screen on. We humans are not supposed to see infrared light, but in dark rooms when the screen is off I can actually see the three infrared lights on, which is really creepy. I found it so disturbing having those three red lights on in the night that I actually turn Moto Display off (which luckily turns off the infrared lights). Maybe someone else can check if in dark rooms with Moto Display on and the screen off they can see those infrared (not so infra) lights glowing?

Don’t get me wrong, I think for the money it is a really great phone and to have a slightly better phone you will have to expend much more money.

Hope this helps!","4.0 out of 5 stars"

The speakers are loud enough and I like the front facing speakers having switched from an LG Optimus G phone. The viewing angles are perfect with its Quad HD display. I can really tell the difference between my old 720p phone. It makes reading and watching videos much more enjoyable. Overall, it's a pretty good deal for only 400 dollars unlocked. Although it was pretty big at first, I quickly got used to it and the screen is just big enough to see everything that I need in detail. The battery is much better than my old phone that would use up a chunk of battery on moderate to somewhat heavy use and it would be at 30% before 4:00 (which was the time I got out of school) which I hated on there. The standby times are pretty great. I could just not charge it one night and still have enough to go through half the day the next day. I could normally go through an entire day from waking up at around 10-11 am with light to moderate use and still have 30% leftover before going to bed at around 2 am. On days of heavy use I could find myself at 15 or less but it can't be killed in a day, I figured. The only concern is that it consumes through battery very quickly if you're not careful, and I have to turn the brightness down nearly all the way in order to conserve battery and keep it from overheating (which it does overheat sometimes so keep it cool). The camera is pretty good. It takes pretty great high def photos but it's still not iPhone or Samsung quality. There are some times when the phone will hiccup and lag and sometimes pages will take a while to load or won't load at all so I'd have to refresh to try again. And, sometimes the web browser can crash if it gets to that point, but I think maybe at that point you'd need to just have a little bit of patience and wait, or close out any running apps in the background. But, there's been no stutter between opening apps and scrolling through articles.  But, overall, it's an excellent smartphone if you're trying to dive into the smartphone realm and don't have enough to buy iPhones or Samsungs at their unlocked prices. You can get the same high definition quality for more than half the price off contract. So, I think this aspect is pretty neat. It works with every carrier, and I have Cricket so it's bound to work for other small ones. Just pop in your SIM card and it's ready to run out of the box.","4.0 out of 5 stars"

This Moto X Pure is really a beauty to hold on your hands, I love the feeling of the solid build with good amount of weight and the phone it self functions really well in overall usage.

The camara is way better than the Nexus phones, and reaction time was way faster while taking each shots.

(Black 32 GB).  So far I've had every iOS except the big 6. Also have androids: LG, ASUS, Samsungs, HTC's, Used both AMOLED and LCD. Thought it might be too big for me but has turned out just perfect after a week of getting used to it. Carry in front shirt pocket or front pants pocket. 5'10"" guy. It's an amazing price point and love that Motorola bypasses the carriers and makes a universal device. Currently using the Verizon network via an MVNO with no problem. Just switched the SIM card after cutting it down to nano size. I find the battery life to be excellent.

Update to Marshmallow 6.0 causes some minor glitches in the Motorola add-on bits - specifically ""Moto Voice activation"" in conjunction with ""Google Commands ON"" when the phone is locked doesn't behave. Also, the Android trusted places is glitchy as it was reported on a lot of 6.0 Nexus phones and got fixed with 6.0.1. I hope that 6.0.1 comes out soon for this phone. Prefer the Google camera to stock. Marshmallow doze mode gets me very good battery life - much better than my Samsung. I love the screen. All those software problems can be fixed with Tasker. Otherwise the phone has been rock stable unlike my Zen. A stable tool with all the features working when I need them is very important to me.

I particularly like the fact that Motorola hasn't gone USB-C and has kept the SIM. A touch of extra thickness so you can have multiple standard charge cords available everywhere is worth it. They also don't break all the time like Apple lighting cords. Don't really miss finger print scanner or QI charging. I like ""OK Google"" better than Siri.

Like it enough that I would probably buy it at twice the price if I break this one.","5.0 out of 5 stars"

i started out with a moto g on verizon prepaid,  that was my first smart phone,  i waited till you could get a smart phone plan for a descent price before i finally got one..  it was a very nice phone for around 100 bucks. but not much storage and the verizon version was full of bloat wear.  i could only add a few apps and a couple of games and the memory was full.  any games that were large like asphalt 8  i was not able to play since i did not have enough storage.  the phone was not super snappy or super powerfull but it was great for the money..

next i recently bought a htc 526  since it has a SD cars slot.  but when you moved a app to the sd card it said it was moved but it was still taking up the storage of the phone.  still could not play asphalt 8  since it was also full of bloat wear and most of the storage was taken up.  this phone was not snappy at all,  it lagged big time when trying to do anything.  took for ever to load apps.  all i can say is its a absolutely horrible poor excuse for a smart phone.  a few weeks later i decided to get a nice phone and picked up this moto x pure edition.

The moto X....  i got the 16 gig version,  now i see i could have got the 32 gig version for the same price.  well crap i screwed up but i am fine with the 16 gigs..  i have several games and apps installed, a few of them are pretty large and i still have about 2 gigs of space left,  i can store music and pics and what not on the SD card.  cant figure out how to move a app over to the SD card after it updated to android marshmallow.  before the update it had the option to move the apps,  now i cant find that option..  but hey  ill tell you what.  this phone is very snappy,  loads apps and games quickly,  plays games no problem.  this is what i would imagine a good phone should be like..  this thing just works the way it should.  seems just as good if not better than my friends latest and greatest i phones,  not sure how this holds up compared to the really high end android phones but i really cant imagine them being any better than this besides maybe having more storage.

my only real complaint is sound quality when listening with head phones.  the sound is very thin,  say the electric guitar on rock and roll music,  its kind of on the bright side,  not a nice warm sound like i am used to hearing, also when the volume gets past a certin point the sound starts to get a bit muddy and is not as clear..  i have a very nice set of head phones,  both my moto g and the HTC music sounded great when i was listening with these head phones but the moto x is dissapointing,  really it just needs a equalizer to add some low mids to warm up the sound and make it sound a bit more beefy. but i cant seem to find a EQ that will work with Pandora,  i mainly just stream music on Pandora.  as far as the built in speakers they are pretty impressive,  the sound great for tiny little phone speakers and the phone gets pretty darn loud too,  they also sound a bit muddy once you start to get the volume up there when listening to music but over all i guess i cant complain about the built in speakers..  these built in speakers sound better than some laptop speakers do i would say..  i guess ill have to put some music on my SD card and try to find a player that will allow me to EQ the sound.

the camera takes nice photos and videos.  i just wish the camera had some manual controols so you could set the ISO, aperture and shutter speed where you want them,  i am a photographer that shoots manual mode on my real cameras and it would be nice to be able to do the same here but hey its a phone and the camera is pretty good,  not bad in low light either,  much better than the camera on either of my old phones.

the screen looks great, videos and games and photos on this phone look very very good,  probably better than my HD TV looks,  ts a bit large but not too big IMO,  fits in my pockets just fine but if i bend forward for a hamstring stretch or something like that the phone digs into my hip but any other time i dont really notice it in my pocket,  if your working out or doing yoga or something it might be a issue,  for every day use just walking aorund, setting down and stuff like that its not a issue at all for me...  my friend has a phone with a 6 inch screen and that is just too big,  i would not want a screen any bigger than this.  preferably i like a 5.5 inch screen as far as fitting the thing in your pocket comfortably,  this screen looks a good deal bigger than a 5.5 inch screen but does not really feel bigger in my pocket.  now compard to a 5 inch or 5.2 inch screen those are much better as far as pocketability goes.  but its sure nice to have a screen this size when you are using the phone..

all i can say is this phone is great.  very glad i got this one.","5.0 out of 5 stars"

Really appreciate the pure Android experience that's not bogged down by bloatware.  Super fast charging.  Sound quality is great.  Surprised at how good music sounds on it.  Gets an ATT signal where my LG-G2 would not.  I live on the highest point of my city, surrounded by cell towers, and my LG-G2 had trouble selecting a tower and maintaining signal.  No more trouble.  Also gets a signal in far rural Wisconsin where my LG could not.  If I had it to do over again, I would order the 32gb model, as the operating system takes up quite a bit of memory.  I have about 3GB left, with quite a few large apps downloaded to it.  The saving grace is the ability to store photos and certain apps on a micro SD card.  Camera is great in most situations, but struggles in certain conditions.  Smart phones may never offer the photo quality people expect from a full sized camera.  That's why I own a DSLR.  Excellent value for the money.  (About 400.00 USD).  This phone performs far better than my LG-G2, and it cost about 300.00 USD less than the locked LG did on contract.  It has fallen out of my shirt pocket (edge protected), to the floor several times and continues to perform flawlessly.  Now it resides safely in my front pants pocket, where it fits nicely.

Didn't care to customize colors myself, but that's a cool offering if you buy direct from Motorola. I bought a Sprint SIM card (Part # SIMGLW446C) at a brick&mortar Best Buy.

My previous phone is a Samsung Galaxy Note II. I skipped several generations as the Note2 did everything I needed. But over the past few months its performance was more and more sluggish, and I was never really happy with the camera. And obviously Samsung stopped releasing updates a long time ago, and even when they did support the Note2 the releases were many months late.

I chose the Moto X Pure as I liked the idea of a phone majoring on the majors, good screen, good camera, decent battery life, and sticking close to stock Android. As I looked into it further I liked the idea of an affordable unlocked phone that could work with any phone network. If and when Sprint goes toes up I can switch carriers without a lot of fuss.

After powering up I connected to my home WiFi and installed the latest Android OTA update. Very easy, took about an hour to finish. I popped the SIM card into the phone (opening the tray requires a tiny Motorola tool, essentially a tiny paperclip with a handle), logged into Sprint.com from a desktop computer, and activated the phone service very very easily.

The form factor is very similar to the the Note2, in both size and weight. I am perfectly fine with plastic - shiny metal or glass enclosures hold no appeal to me. The screen is noticeably more crisp especially within the OS. I'm still getting used to Marshmallow but I like it so far. The stock keyboard is superb. I enjoy the very subtle vibrate-on-key-press, a very superficial thing that nevertheless adds to the feeling of a premium phone.

I've only taken a few pictures but the camera is light-years beyond the old Note2 camera. I can't compare it to other recent phones but man, good pix.

I plan to update this review as OS updates are released. Thanks Motorola for filling a niche in the marketplace that was ideal for me.","5.0 out of 5 stars"

The camera is decent under good lighting conditions, but if you're at a concert, or anywhere where light is not perfect, do not expect to have good results. Overall I can't complain about the phone though. Calls are clear, and the stereo front facing speakers are a dream! Do yourself a favor and get yourself a Nexus 5 or 6 if you're looking for camera quality. I'm tempted to purchase a OnePlus Two to carry around just for photos and have this for my main device.

1) Display - I'm probably in the minority on this but I actually prefer LCD to AMOLED and the X actually offers one of the better LCDs in terms of displaying natural colors. While not the standout display the the Galaxy s7 possesses, this is certainly nothing to sneeze at.

2) stereo speakers - They sound fantastic. On par with Boomsound or the Alcatel Idol 3 (probably a little bassier than the idol even at higher volumes). Very pleased.

3) Camera - amazing in sunlight. decent in lowlight. Definitely not a deal breaker and a nice upgrade from previous phones used recently (idol3 , m8 etc).

4) water resistance - always good to have that piece of mind.

5) Performance - This thing is buttery smooth. I've yet to experience any lag whatsoever. Runs marshmallow the way that it was intended. It's quick and probably stacks up with most high end phones out there. Stock Android is fantastic and the moto software only enhances the experience. The ability to text someone while sitting across the room from your phone is quite awesome.

6) screen size / hardware - Feels solid. Bamboo back looks / feels amazing. The metal around the edges also feels nice. 5.7 inches is a perfect screen size for me,

Overall the moto X at $300 to $400 truly makes me question why / how Samsung, Apple etc can charge upwards of $800 for their flagship devices. Yes their camera experience may be slightly better but I cannot think of anything else that would justify $400 more for an s7 (the snapdragpn 820 maybe?). Plus the X offers the ability to choose your carrier. Overall I'm very happy with the X and looking forward to hanging on to this device for some time.","5.0 out of 5 stars"

Even though it's big, I thought it was going to be bigger and heavier than really it's. It comes with the turbo charger and a bumper case that seems to be good to protect the phone from falls and hits. it came with Android 6.0. The only thing I'm worried about is that the phone looks like easy to crack on falls. By the way, using it in Venezuela with Movistar with no problem.

----UPDATE----
After a month with this phone, my conclusions:
- Screen: 4/5, beautiful screen with good brightness and color. Clear text and images.
- Speed for business: 4/5, great for email, documents, social networks, browsing... No problems so far, everything seems to bee snappy.
- Speed for games: 3.5/5, I haven't tested it a lot on games but on the few I did, it did well.
- Sound: 4.5/5, beautiful sound through the speakers, with its stereo speakers music and voice sound crisp and clear with good balance of high and low tones.
- Battery: 4/5, it lasts a full day (from 7:30am to 10pm) with moderate use: some pictures (with and without flash), 1hr or 2hrs of social network and browsing, 30min of email, 2hrs of messaging and chat. It could be better but considering the big screen and network connections I think it does well. It charges fast, 10-15min of charging gives you 2 or 4 additional hours of life.
- Camera: 4/5, can't complain, it takes good images with the front camera and great ones with the back camera. It's fast with some good basic options.
- Feeling: 4.5/5, the device feels great in hands and it looks awesome, everybody has loved it. The only thing, it's a bit slippery on soft surfaces so be aware.
- Bumper case: 4/5, not sure how much it protects but it feels and it looks awesome on the phone. It would be great to be able to buy more of this but I can't find it.
- Call quality: 4.5/5, no problem, awesome reception for voice and data compared to my old Samsung Galaxy S4 i9500.","5.0 out of 5 stars"

PRO:
- The speakers kick butt on the M7 as far as volume is concerned.  They can be turned up so loud they will overdrive if you're not careful.
- The quick peek notifications are great.  Phone knows when you take it out of your pocket and look at it, so I'm not constantly clicking the unlock button to see notifications.
- Turbo charging, WOW.  I'm not even remotely concerned about running down the battery on a days use, which I haven't done yet.  3 hours of straight screen on use, battery down to 60%.  Plug in charger, 12 min to 100%
- Smart lock is great.  I used to use llama for location based unlocking and it was a battery drainer.
- Moto Migrate was quick to use for contacts and messages, but I would not recommend it for images or music.
- Bamboo back give a lot better grip than I was expecting.

CONS:
- This is my first phone in the new larger size.  As some one with smaller hands I already miss the ability to type and hold with one hand.  This is however purely my choice in size and not necessarily a deficit to others.
- I didn't like that I couldn't use Moto Voice and ""Ok, Google"" side by side.  Seems it should be able to listen for more than one attention phrase.  I went back to ""Ok, Google"" because it seemed like 3/4 of the time Moto Voice just passed my question or command to ""Ok, Google"" anyway.

OBSERVATIONS:
I've heard people complain about it having a poor viewing angle because it is a TFT display.  I think it is no worse than the AMOLED on my old HTC.","5.0 out of 5 stars"

For the price it should be far better than it is. What do I like about it?  It launches apps quickly and has a good screen.  It recharges quickly.  The problems?  When playing simple games there is lag that should not be there and is not there with phones even half the price. (For example the Asus Zenfone 2 that I owned prior to this was as fast and never had lag and is $200.)  Also, the speaker phone is too sensitive.  So if you want to talk 20 feet away from the phone, and there's no other noise in the room...it's perfect.  But if you are holding the phone even the scraping of your fingers on the phone will be painfully loud to the other party. (It's worse with a case.)  So I'm strongly considering sending this back and just keeping my Zenfone 2. I'm not sure if I am just spoiled with that phone or this one is that average.

UPDATE: Something happened with the upgrade of the OS to Android 6.0 Marshmallow.  Now all calls give me clicking or other noises into my ear.  The other party can here me fine but it's aggravating to have no good sound.","3.0 out of 5 stars"

I bought it to replace my old MotoX 1st generation, which was the best phone I have ever used. If this phone had been available in the smaller size of the 1st generation, I would have upgraded much earlier, if only to get the improved camera. I still prefer the smaller size, but the big format has not been as much a problem as I anticipated, and it is obviously much nicer for reading or any kind of graphics. The main drawback I am experiencing is that it is harder to hold with one hand and scroll with the thumb, and in the process of changing grip, I often inadvertently change something on the screen because the bezel is so thin that in order to hold on, my fingers overlap onto the screen. I am using it without a case of any kind, and I might add one just for this reason. The transition of all my data from the old phone to this one was very easy, very fast, and very accurate. I am on Verizon, and it was very easy to activate the phone simply by putting in a new Verizon SIM card (they're free at the Verizon store). I could have taken the card out of the old MotoX, but I didn't want to do that because it is still a very usable phone. I do wish the dual-SIM tray was actually functional -- it would have been useful for foreign travel -- but oh well, I didn't even know about it when I ordered the phone.","5.0 out of 5 stars"

The sound on this phone is purely crisp - loud - and STEREO! The design is logic and useful at its point of daily use. I have TurboCharge AKA quick charge 2.0 qualcomm (google is your best friend) and get to use it heavy due to my technical job.

Let me start with the things I like about the phone.

1. OS: I appreciate how close Moto stays to stock Android. I use Nova Launcher to customize the look and feel.
2. Moto Apps: the few apps that Motorola ships with the phone enhance the phone's usability. I really like Moto Voice and gestures, although I don't think I'm using them to their fullest potential.
3. Updates: so far, security updates are rolling out in a timely fashion, and we've gotten Android Marshmallow.
4. SD card: it's nice to be able to extend the storage in the device, I have 64GB in mine and that is more than adequate.
5. Size: yes, it's large. But I'm coming from a Sony Z Ultra, so  anything with a screen under 5.5"" is too small for me. I have no problem getting the phone in a back pocket (just make sure you remove it before sitting down).
6. Appearance: I love the bamboo/champagne/white color scheme of the phone. It doesn't get dirty easily and doesn't seem to have issues with scratches or the veneer coming off.
7. Performance: overall, the phone is snappy and seldom bogs down when having multiple apps open. Wifi is fast, as is my T-Mo LTE connection; I don't have problems with connecting or maintaining a connection.
8. Speakers: the front-facing speakers are loud and easy to hear.
9. NFC: this is important to me because I use NFC to connect to my BT headphones and for Android Pay.

The cons are few, but they keep me from loving the phone wholeheartedly:

1. Battery life: battery life is OK, but not stellar. On a typical day, I can make it about 10 hours, low to medium brightness, ~3.25-3.5 hrs SOT. I know that your can use the TurboPower charger, but that isn't always an option (think Disneyland). So, if you *need* great battery life and don't want to have to top off to get it, this may not be the phone for you.
2. Heat: my phone can get pretty warm, especially when the screen brightness is high. I notice it because the metal  Moto dimple on the back gets very warm, and that's where you put your finger. I've never had it force-shutdown from heat, but it is disconcerting when it heats up.
3. Camera software: I am not crazy about Moto's camera software.  I prefer a tap-to-focus, not a tap-to-take-picture interface. I find it awkward. I also find that the phone can hunt for focus, especially when you are trying to capture a moving subject, resulting in blurry pictures when you least want them. As annoying as it can be, the camera problems could be fixed via a software update, so this may not a be a problem in the future.

All in all, while there a few downsides, the phone as a whole is quite impressive. When you factor it's PRICE into the equation, it makes the phone even more attractive and a strong recommendation if you're looking for a combination of performance and value.

If you're thinking about a case, I've found that the Invisible Armor Xtreme Slim Clear TPU case is great if you want to have a very thin, clear case to show off your phone's back. If you prefer more protection for your phone, I like the Incipio Octane cases in Frost; they're translucent but not transparent and not terribly bulky.","4.0 out of 5 stars"

I have only had this phone for a couple days and will update my review later should my point of view change but so far I am very happy with the Moto X Pure Edition phone.  The LTE connection works well; the Wifi connection works extremely well and I was so happy to learn that I could surf the internet and check email, etc over WiFi rather than consuming data - a feature I have enjoyed with my old Nokia Lumia Windows phone.  I tested this by setting up my phone without a sim card and I had full functionality other than making calls.

I noticed in settings that the phone has Tethering capabilities too, although I have not tried this functionality.

Consumer Cellular is my carrier and I noticed that I am getting one extra bar in signal strength compared to what I was getting with my 4G Nokia Lumia phone on the same service.  Set up was super easy - I just transferred the sim from my old phone to the Pure Edition and did one reboot.  The phone installed the correct APN for Consumer Cellular automatically.  I did not need to call Consumer Cellular.

There is no FM Radio functionality so you will need to download an app from the Play Store if you like to listen to FM radio.

I took a couple of photos indoors of my dog today and while the indoor photos looked dark the camera has features that will allow you to adjust the brightness, sharpness and crop photos as well as some other camera features that I have not explored yet.  After applying the brightness and crop tools I was very happy with the results.

Battery life in standby mode has been excellent but it can decrease fairly rapidly with heavy use but no worse than the Samsung Galaxy that I tried before I bought the Pure Edition.  The TurboPower Charger is really appreciated as an inclusion with the phone.  As others have said it  really does charge the phone very rapidly which could be your savior if stuck at an airport due to flight delays but not having long access to a power plug.

The sound from the speakers and for conversations is excellent.  The screen is beautiful and details are sharp plus you have the option of changing wallpaper or using a photo as your wallpaper by simply touching the little dots that are located right above the apps icon.  This shrinks the page to reveal the wallpaper, widget and settings icons.  Motorola included some really nice wallpaper options including some that are animated.

As for the animations during start-up, I too could do without those.

So far I like everything about the phone with a few exceptions that do not impact my rating at this time.  Those exceptions are:
1)  Lack of an FM Radio feature
2)  Non-removable battery
3)  Those silly animations during start-up
4)  The fact that the internal storage shows about 8GB less Total Space than what I purchased which is a 32GB phone - I just find that odd.

I tend to keep my phones for a long time (usually about 4 years) before upgrading and I seriously doubt the battery will last that long.  If the battery does not last at least 3 years my rating will be different.  This is the first phone I have purchased that has a non-removable battery so we'll see how it goes.

I definitely would not pay any more for a phone that did not have a removable battery.  I paid $475 for my phone so if the battery lasts three years that means the phone is costing me slightly over $13 per month for three years of use (not counting service of course).  If I add Moto-Care accident protection/extended warranty that pushes the price up even higher.

As referenced above my only question is given that I purchased a 32GB phone why would the Total Space (NOT referring to Available Space, but Total Space) in Settings only show 24GB?  I am assuming the space used by the system is hidden, but the fact that the system does not show 32GB Total Space does cause me to question just how much space is really in the phone.  The Available Space is just under 20GB.","5.0 out of 5 stars"

Phone makers need to go back to making phones that can actually fit in your pocket for those of us that use their phone primarily as a phone.  I don't need a large screen or a super high tech camera.  However, I want the speed of the new processors so that I can use it for certain things for work.","4.0 out of 5 stars"

The power button is flimsy and clearly not designed to actually be used.  I have to restart the phone because its stopped working at least once every couple of days.  The battery life is atrocious.  I don't use apps, yet it basically lasts a day.  I'm at work for 8 hours and sleeping for 8 hours, so my phone sits unused on my nightstand for 16 hours a day and somehow it still runs out of battery.  My old basic smartphone would last at least 3 days before I needed to charge it.","2.0 out of 5 stars"

It does get a bit warm (hot actually) in the beginning, but as the phone ""ages"", it seems to not run so hot. I guess the phone is learning??? Screen and camera are very nice. As with any phone or tablet, the speed and capability will degrade with more and more apps running, so don't blame the phone if you overload it. I will say that it does run much faster than my two year old phone, and I think the build is also better. I added a 64 gb memory card so there is a ton of storage available. I expect that to be all I need until I someday replace this phone (I don't do a lot of downloads onto the phone). Top of the line device!","5.0 out of 5 stars"

I have owned Samsung Galaxy Notes I have owned LG Gs I have owned iPhones,  and HTC in my lifetime. I have tried out all of the major brands that appeal to me. This was my first time that I owned a Motorola smartphone. Well this x pure has amazed me at every level. It is very well built.  It flies speedwise,  the screen is almost as good as aa flagship samsung,  but at half the price the difference between the two is really minimal. The weakest point of the phone is the camera,  in low lights it doesn't perform well but it is passable,  and the stock photo app is terrible. I changed it to another camera app and am content now. I got a 16gb model and purchased 128gb card and with Android 6.0 you can merge your card to your phone. So not I have 144gb of storage...  I can download as I wish and not worry about space. Grab this phone,  the construction is top of the lone the metal rim round the phone hives it a iPhone or htc feel,  very high end feel. I look forward to the 2016 version.","5.0 out of 5 stars"

The display is very nice 1440p, though not as nice as the AMOLED screens that can make dark black. I like the design and centered usb port, headphone jack, camera and finger rest. The speakers are stereo and very loud for a phone. Though I have only used it for 3 days now, it is very fast and responsive. It comes with limited 3rd party software, which is a huge plus, and it can be easily disabled and opted out of. Many people will find the Motorola display and gesture software combined with the infrared front sensors on the phone useful to quickly check the time/notifications. I prefer my phone screen to stay off until I hit the unlock button, so with a bit of looking and tinkering I have disabled those settings. I haven't yet found the need to root the phone, which I normally do for speed reasons and the ability to seriously customize my phone.. With Nova Launcher and Custom Icon Packs, You can make your phone look very amazing. So far I am extremely satisfied with the phone, and hopefully it stays that way.","5.0 out of 5 stars"

It's definitely not great though. Now that I've used it for a few months, I've found it to be slow. It has touch delay, like all android phones. The Motorola camera app is probably the worst camera app of all time, and it's pared with an incredibly underwhelming sub-par camera. There is no music player either, just Google Play Music which is awful. Hardware wise, this phone is great. No complaints other than it being fat, and heavy. It is very well put together, and durable. I have dropped this down a flight of stairs with no case, and there's only a very very small dent in a corner. Software wise, it could use a lot of work.

I regret buying this phone and would be much happier just saving up a bit more, and buying an iPhone.","3.0 out of 5 stars"

Edition), Moto X (2014) and now the new Pure Edtion. I love it! Working with several techies I see all current phones in the hands of my colleagues and had the chance to check out the iPhone 6S Plus and Nexus 6P too before committing to the Pure Edition with an all-in attitude. I can afford any phone my heart desires, but the chance to buy this on Amazon for $349 sealed the deal - what an great price. I cannot comment enough how easy the phone is to use, how fast it is, how sophisticated it is, but the new camera takes great shots and the stabilization in the video is quite noticeable if you own a phone without that feature. The battery life is excellent and have yet to have it quit during my day, however the quick charger included makes fast charging a breeze - all I need is like 20 minutes and I'm good till well into the next day. The Moto X 2014 is still in my possession and is also amazing.

Most importantly to me, this phone has everything I could want, but the cellular radio is incredible and before this phone I would get dead spots in certain coverage areas, but now I get LTE where I could not before.

You can use this phone with numerous unlocked carriers such a Ptel, T-Mobile and many other mobile virtual network operators.","5.0 out of 5 stars"

Btw, phone was very well protected by hybrid case and glass screen protector. Never had any other android go belly up like this trash. Now I have to go back and forth with Amazon and/or Motorola, oh joy! Speaking of which Moto's online lookup tool doesn't seem to recognize the phones IMEI so that should be a treat and Amazon says the refund period is over.

Very light and easy to carry, despite the large screen.

Has an MicroSD Card slot, which is a great option to expand storage that Nexus devices (to which this one is often compared) currently lack.

Motorola also has a better history than most with keeping their phones up to date with the latest Android, which is always important.

Back is grippy is comfortable.

Active Display is REALLY useful. The ability to see basic notification by just bringing your hand close to the screen becomes second nature very quick.

One thing you'll probably want to do is go to developer options and increase the speed of animations. Phone looks a lot slower than it actually is because transitions are artificially made slow. (Google how to do it ;D).

To be honest, would have bought a Nexus 6P if buying it wasn't the complete nightmare Google makes it. But barring that, this is the best cell phone in the market IMHO.","5.0 out of 5 stars"

The softback is very nice. The bumper case that comes with it is a nice touch. Thw phone is just absolutely beautiful. Activating through Verizon is tricky. But it worked.

5. Outstanding speakers (front-facing dual stereo)
6. Great software (near stock Android 6.0)
7. Incredible charging speed (with the included charger)

Cons
1. Mediocre battery life (3,000mAh)
2. Camera's lowlight performance

Conclusion
The Moto X Pure Edition brings incredible value to the table. In my opinion, it's better than the OnePlus 2 and the Nexus 5X.","5.0 out of 5 stars"
