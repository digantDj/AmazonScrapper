Returned the unit to G-Tech and was informed that the package arrived damaged, which was not the fault of my company's shipping department, it turned out to UPS's fault and UPS is paying for it now. , However, through the entire process, which has been going on for a month now, the support folks at G-Technology have been kind of not very helpful or knowledgeable, if not downright resistant and not caring.  Very frustrating\n , \n  I have been a loyal G-TECH/G-SPEED customer for six years. I recommended this product to everyone because it was a tight, loyal RAID and I loved their customer support. Then I upgraded to Mac OS X and the drives would no longer mount. Not only that, but their customer support seems to not have a clue what is going on. , I've just spent the day on tech support with my IT guy only to find out that these drives are no longer officially supported by G-TECH yet, here they are for sale online. I can't tell you how upset I am, considering I have five years' worth of data on these drives, each of which cost around $2,500. , I am now trying to figure out if there is a workaround to get my data off these drives, or if I know anyone with an old Mac OS that I can use to copy files over to a new Pegasus drive. Extremely disappointed. This is absolutely unbelievable. DO NOT BUY THIS DRIVE.",

        "REVIEWS_BODY": "I purchased this to use as a remote editing drive for FCPx and Premiere Pro. I got busy enough that I was taking work home every night and needed something that I could actually edit off of and not use just to transfer files from one system to another (that can just take too long when you have to do it daily). , As for the speed of the drive, it's more or less as advertised. I get consistant 200 mbps read and write except for when the drive gets close to full. At that point it can drop to as low as 100 mbps but this is not unusual for any drive once it starts to get full. , I have two disappointments that keep this from a 5* review. , First, I really wanted a portable bus powered drive, which this claims to be. However, what you should know is that it takes two USB ports to power this drive. One for data transfer and one for powering the drive. You could use a USB power adaptor with the drive instead, but it's still a bit more complicated and messy than just plugging a drive in with a single cable. So, be aware if this is a big deal to you. , The second disappointment is that the USB3 connection on the drive itself is kind of a poor fit for the cable. The cable always feels loose and in one case the drive did unmount from the computer because the cable was moved slightly. For something that is marked and sold as a pro level drive, this should not be. It was bad enough that I considered sending it back but then ended up keeping it. I just have to be careful where I place it and make sure I don't need to move the drive at all once connected. , So overall, great drive for editing if you're OK with these two drawbacks.\n , \n  awesome drive and its super fast!\n , \n  I love this unit! , It is compact and very fast! , Plus it has a very large capacity",

Only drawback - it's not nearly as quiet as some reviewers suggest.\n , \n  Works great. A safe place to store data\n , \n  I bought this on a referral from a fellow photographer.  I have always used WD drives and have been very pleased.  The drive seems to be working ok, but I ran a speed test on it using the Parkdale program and it runs slower than my External single drive WD hard drive that is much cheaper.  So I ask what is the point?  The reason I bought it was for editing photos without having to keep them on my small SSD drive on my laptop  My main issue with this drive is the noise.  The noise from this thing is obnoxious.  It constantly spins and is so loud.  I never even hear any of my other drives.  I called tech support and they say that since there are two drives in the enclosure it will be louder and by nature of the Raid the drives will constantly spin so that it is normal.  This is not normal.  I worked with Raid drives 15 years ago that were never this loud.  Since it is just past the 30 day return mark, I will most likely hook it up to my external network drive that is in another room and use it for additional backup/storage and not my mine working drive and buy something else.  Makes for an expensive backup.",
