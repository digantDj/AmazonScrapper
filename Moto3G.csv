It's been great so far. I even already received my Marshmallow update. The battery life is great especially compared to my last phone that I had for several years, and the camera is miles better than what I usually see on an Android. I like the removable back plate that you can change out if you wish. The phone being water-resistant is great, too. This does not mean you should wash it in the sink, but if it's raining or you set it in some condensation from your cup, it's gonna be fine as long as you have secured the back plate.

All in all, I'm pleased with this phone and I hope it continues to perform well.

Update: I don't know if I ended up with a dud, but for some reason this phone started running super slow, almost to the point of not being usable. I hate to restart it every day in order to use it as a regular phone (texting/phone calls). The audio playback was weird. It would only play a few seconds of a song, or any audio, skip ahead, play a few more seconds, unless I re-winded it back to the beginning. It was bizarre and annoying especially while driving. Sometimes it would just restart itself. I had a 32gB SD card that worked wonderfully for about 3 weeks. Then it randomly wouldn't read it. I would turn off my phone, remove the card, turn my phone back on, replace the card and it would work for about 10 seconds; then my phone would restart and no longer read that an SD card was inserted. So any apps I moved would not open and therefore I couldn't move them back to my phone. I really hope this was simply single bad phone, but I am forced to change my rating and hope you guys have much better luck.","2.0 out of 5 stars"

After I exchanged a phone, had the same problem, and then spent 90 minutes with tech support, we found that there was an update for the Moto G that ultimately corrected the problem.

I really wanted the 2gb Ram/16gb model but it wasn't available and I was hoping to get a feel for the phone early on with some business travel coming up (review is based on the 1gb/8gb model).

Packaging is clean - the device comes in slim packaging compared with previous Nexus 6/Moto E packaging, however is nicely protected.  When unboxing and flipping the phone over the first thing I noticed is the instructions on the back panel of the phone on how to properly remove the cover/reseal it in order to get the best water resistance.  I also ordered a blue cover from Motorola directly which should arrive next week.  While the back cover is removable the battery is not user replaceable - this may be a factor for some but I carry an external battery when travelling for work.

The device itself does not by any means feel like a budget smart phone.  It's leaps and bounds better in terms of overall build quality compared to some recently released devices such as the Huawei P8 Lite or Alcatel Idol 3.  It is also much more refined than last years G and this years Moto E.  The US Model ships with a MicroSD card slot and a single sim card slot (XT1540).  I really like the textured rear cover although the device may end up going into a case - I had never dropped cell phones in using them for 10 or so years until recently when I managed to drop them 2 or 3 times over the course of the past month.

The display seems decent enough for a 720p offering, never for a moment did I look at it and feel it was a huge downgrade over something like the Idol 3 or iPhone 6 (PPI will be somewhat lower however it still offers a nice display and most likely a power savings driving a lower res display).

Performance, while it does not seem to lag by any means is not quite up to par with the afformentioend devices however, as the Moto G - Gen 3 ships with a Snapdragon 410 instead of a 615 as many midrange devices now utilize.  By no means did I feel performance was poor, but when benchmarking/gaming you will absolutely notice a performance delta between the Moto G and something utilizing a SD6xx/8xx.

Performance actually seems better somehow (perhaps a better Android image or maybe because it ships with 5.1.1?) than the Moto E which I haven't tried with 5.1+ quite yet.  I'll update later with experiences once I've had a chance to do so.  Antutu turned a benchmark of 23,282 which is fairly respectable for a budget device - for comparison the 2nd generation Moto G using a SnapDragon 400 turned in a score of 17,000 so there is a significant enough performance boost with the new G - roughly a 27% performance improvement over its predecessor.

Battery Life I really couldnt say quite yet as I have it on the charger right now and haven't had much of a chance to utilize the device operating off of its battery quite yet but I will update the review once I have a chance to further utilize.  I will say the charge time seemed significant however.

Conslusion:
I'm really happy with the device so far and really don't regret purchasing the 1gb model at this point.  I put a 32gb Micro SD card in to provide some additional storage and seemed to be able to move some apps to SD through application manager.  I don't think anyone coming from a previous gen model would be dissatisfied with the changes made to the 2015 Moto G.  I'll update as I have more of a chance to use the device.","5.0 out of 5 stars"

I intend to use this as my backup phone, once the Moto X Style is released.

Pros
- Water resistant (sort of - see cons)
- Snappy performance, considering the low specs. Compared to HTC One M9, it is noticeably slower, but not by a large margin. Definitely acceptable performance.
- No bloatware, near stock Android experience. This is  important to me because OS stability is a must-have. Have not encountered any substantial bugs or performance issues.
- Moto Assist and active notifications (love this feature). Does not support always-on voice controls (missed this from my Moto X).
- Great camera for outdoors / well-lit environments. Don't expect great night shots, but if taking portraits in a controlled environment using flash, results come out fine. Did experience red-eye effect in several night time flash photos.
- Good screen. Good daytime visibility. Lower resolution is noticeable compared to higher resolution phones. For day to day use, I find this perfectly fine.
- Good battery life. Averaged 3-4 hours of screen on time per charge.
- Price

Cons
- After light exposure to water (submerging 1 foot of pool water for less than 30 seconds), needs to dry several hours before the earpiece / speakerphone starts working again. This could be a problem if you're expecting to make phone calls. I've found myself having to use speakerphone for all my calls until the earpiece dried up.
- Headphone jack does not work, 36 hours after exposure to water. I will likely be returning this unit. Hopefully this is not the case for all Moto G3s. I have not read of any other instances of this occurring.

Conclusion -
I entertained the idea of using this as a primary phone rather than buying the Moto X Style. The only thing holding me back is the camera's nighttime capabilities, and the water resistant issues. If you're not a phone junkie (like me) who needs to have the best of the best, I highly recommend this phone for it's value, simplicity, relatively good camera, and good battery life.","4.0 out of 5 stars"

So far my research has paid off. Definitely didn't have to spend 2-3 tmes as much for a phone. It iS a phone after all.

The display is sharp and attractive. Call quality is clear. The apps load very quickly...if they could respond any more quickly it would have to be an A.I. inside the thing linked to a chip in my head. Video plays smoothly, and although I get sharper pictures on my 4K t.v., It is a phone...after all. I have the 2gb version because the research pointed to that being the preferred model. Had to wait a few months to get that configuration on Amazon, but it was preferred over ordering directly...just in case there was a problem. That may be part of why the speed is good. Nice to have the 32 gb SD card option. Can't think of why other mfgs. would do away with that. (I don't believe in the cloud yet. In olden days it was easy to rob banks because they were just getting security up to speed. I think the cloud is like that-for now.)

The tactile sensors are good for typing and are fairly accurate, even with my fat fingers. Screen rotation works well, but I do wish the home screen would rotate; won't go to landscape view. No onboard bluetooth manager, but the linking software works. Will have to find a decent bluetooth app. Having trouble getting images from my old Galaxy phone onto this unit by bluetooth. Only 2 pics transfered and then only after repeated attempts. Kept getting a ghostly notification that a paired device was sending and asking me to confirm, but there was no confirmation button on the notification window...and then it just vanishes. The xfer then fails.

I will put this unit through paces and will update if anything significant comes up. 4 stars because it's a good phone and great for the value.

Edit: The battery does not last all day. Both days it lasted no more than 16 hours. Web shopping, texts, surfing and an hour of Pandora  took it down 80%. I will activate battery saver and see if the numbers can be improved. If it cannot handle more than that, then video streaming will crush it.","4.0 out of 5 stars"

Lost another star for bad customer support...
My phone developed a 2mm diameter bright spot in center of screen.
I just looked into getting warranty service.  I can send them back my phone and be without a phone for who knows how long (not a reasonable option in today's day and age) or pay them a $99 deposit and a $25 non-refundable fee for them to ship me a used phone to replace my phone before I then send them my broken phone so that I don't have to be without a phone.
So not only do I have to deal with the hassle of returning a broken phone, I have to pay a $25 fee (14% of the phone's original cost) for the privilege of having my phone's screen fail.
This level of service should be free, not $25.","3.0 out of 5 stars"

I've only had the Moto G for a short time, but so far have found it to perform just as well as my old phone (better in some regards, but that's more about the carrier than the phone!) and meets my needs quite well.

Now to be fair, I am not a ""power"" user of smartphones...that's why I have a laptop.  ;-)  But what I do is, make a few calls each day, send and receive texts, check e-mail occasionally and play a couple of games when I find myself waiting somewhere with nothing else to do.  And when I'm on wi-fi i have used it to watch ESPN or to see what's on Directv and I find the video quality to be fine for that.  Calls are crystal clear and no issues syncing with my cars Sync software for hands free operation.  Haven't taken any ""real"" pictures yet, (clicked to make sure it works...that's all so far) but based on the specs, expecting it will perform well.  So far i'm finding that I can go 3+ days on a single charge based on my usage, and that is really nice.

Overall I would say if you're looking for a solid dependable smartphone and don't want to spend $500 or more for a flagship phone, give this one a serious look.  It's a nice size phone (without being too large) and feels solid in your hand.  Add a 32gb SD card, like I did, and you have ton's of storage a decent processor and the latest version of Android to boot!

P.S. Just to clarify, i purchased the 16gb/2gb ram model.  Based on technical reviews I had read, the 2gb of ram should help a lot with performance.","5.0 out of 5 stars"

I'm very happy with all the features (screen, camera, call quality) but unfortunately it just doesn't have enough storage space. The problem is that out of the 8GB of storage you only get about 4.5GB of actual space.. This means that after installing  as little as 10 or so apps (or 2 big games), you will run out of storage. One would think that adding a SD card would be a cheap way to solve the problem (that's what I did), but unfortunately Android handles the SD card different than main storage so, although helpful for pictures and music, most apps won't install on the SD card (and the ones that do, will only install partially). So do yourself a favor and get the 16GB version which gives you almost triple the storage space available for apps (about 12GB). This extra space for apps (and not having to monitor your storage space all the time) are well worth the extra money.","1.0 out of 5 stars"

Based on the reviews (lots of contributions which were very helpful, and why I'm writing this - to try to return the favor) I picked up this Moto G 3rd Gen 16GB.  The waterproof feature, expandable memory, and better than decent (to sum up what i learned in other reviews) camera, build quality, as well as the promised battery life (""all day long battery') were big selling points. I figured with the less than bleeding edge processor and the lower pixel density on the screen it would deliver, despite the battery not being ""huge"". After a week with it, I'm returning it.

Here's what the Moto G delivered on:
*Expandable memory (sort of - the apps i tried to use when the SD card was set as 'internal[' didn't see the SD card as internal). It was cool to be able to load most of  my music on to the card and not worry about streaming it from the cloud and burning up data - I could listen to whatever I felt like and not have to think it through and strategize around storage limitations and data availability/limits
*Camera was as advertised, though i didn't have time to use it in a lot of different situations. Quick to focus, nice quick adjustments (white balance) in the app
*Build quality was solid - a little dense in the hand, but really felt solid like it could handle a little life abuse and no worries
*Screen - looked great. Sharp, good color balance

What was OK:
*Performance - speed, power, smoothness were all decent. Not as good at the 5x, of course, but I could live with this phone's performance level.

What it did not deliver on:
*Battery life - just stupid horrible. The phone would churn through 40% of the batter before I left the house in the morning (up at 615, out by 9am). Over the course of the week I tried all the tricks I had used in the past to reduce/eliminate (airplane mode, resetting, deleting apps that check for updates constantly, decreasing email sync frequency, more resets). The original Moto G I have as a back up phone was putting this third generation model to shame. I can leave that old thing sitting around for a couple of days or more just hanging out in standby and the battery life slowly leaks away as expected. Not the case with the 3rd Gen.

I wish I had been able to figure out what the problem was. My best guess was that the TMO LTE band 4 in my area is just not good enough to keep the phone happy and not burning up power working the radio to keep connected. Band 12 is in my area, and that is what I'm hoping will make the Moto X Pure a keeper phone","3.0 out of 5 stars"

Pros:
-Excellent build quality
-Looks and feels like a far more expensive device
-Stock android runs very fluidly
-Great daylight photographs
-A real brand name means better support and warranty service

Cons:
-Some minor autofocus issues
-Low-light photograph quality is lacking
-Screen isn't the greatest
-1GB of Ram on lower end model can be limiting

Summary:  After playing around with the Moto G (3rd Gen) for a couple of hours I was convinced: this is one of the best sub-$200 phones out right now. The combination of a great build quality, stable operating system and decent camera make it a winner for those who don’t need a high-end device.

Full Review:

Build Quality & Appearance:
When I first picked up the Moto G (3rd Generation) my mind was blown. The build quality of this device is excellent for its price range. The plastic it is made of has a nice texture and is firm: there is absolutely no flex or ‘cheap’ feeling to it. It’s great that the phone has waterproof capabilities too. I wouldn’t personally take it swimming, but it’s just a little bit extra peace of mind. I’m a big fan of the feel of the textured back. It adds a nice edge to an otherwise plain smartphone. The front looks like a standard smartphone and while a bit boring I couldn’t find anything to fault with it.

Screen Quality:
The screen is one of the more disappointing parts of this device. It is 720p, and even with a smaller screen size it is possible to see individual pixels. There is a “screen-door” effect, meaning that the black lines between pixels are slightly visible. That being said, the screen has quite nice color and tonal range and it looks good from most angles. The screen is not a deal breaker, but I wish Motorola had sourced a 1080p screen for this device, especially at the higher price point of the larger storage model.

Performance & Storage:
The touch screen is quick and responsive and the U.I. runs extremely smooth even on the 1GB ram / 8 GB rom version. I would suggest getting the 2 / 16 GB version when it becomes more readily available but if you’re a light smartphone user the smaller storage space will be enough. This phone offers expansion via Micro SD so you can store media including pictures and videos on it.

Camera:
One feature that surprised me about The Moto G (3rd Gen) was how good daylight photographs are. After having used a dozen budget smartphones in this price range, I wasn’t expecting much. Previous generations of this phone haven’t had the best camera so I wasn’t expecting much, but it seems Motorola has really stepped up their game and used a sensor was great colour, adequate detail and speedy shooting.

Despite having excellent daylight photo quality, there were a few issues I noticed with the camera. First, the autofocus in the default camera app was quite poor. It would lock focus on an object then not refocus fast enough. Often, this meant I would miss focus. When I touched to focus it would often choose to focus on the object beside the one I tapped on. It is possible to mitigate the autofocus issue with a different camera app installed. Second, night time photography suffered from severe noise and detail loss. They were still far better than other phones I've used at this price point, but not as good as higher end models.

Audio Quality and Signal:
Through my time with the device I didn't have any issues with audio quality or signal. Calls were clear and callers said I sounded good to their ear. The speaker wasn't as loud or clear as it could be, but it was better than many other budget devices I have tried. Media audio through the headphone jack was fine. Wireless stayed connected with no noticeable lag nor signal loss.

Battery Life:
Battery life is decent. With moderate to heavy use I got just over a day out of it, occasionally rounding off into the second day. This is with some text messaging, taking a few pictures, browsing the web for a while, social media and listening to music. It nearly matches any flagship device, which is quite astounding at this price point, though the heaviest of users still may not find it enough. It's worth noting that there is no removable battery so if you do run out you will need a portable battery or a wall outlet.

Conclusion:
I’m thoroughly impressed with what Motorola has put together. With most budget smartphones some things are sacrificed in order to keep the cost low. Other than the screen, this phone is on par with many of the budget phone specs in its price range. It’s not a phone for power users but most people would be happy with it. The Moto G (3rd Gen) would be a perfect buy for casual smartphone users and those who don’t need all the big specs of a high end device.

Facebook, Google and Wechat work OK but surfing forget it. It is in use in Thailand and works with both AIS & DTAC. Have not tried TRUE but what for? The phone locks up and has to be rebooted many times. Downloading pictures from a computer they do not appear on the phone.

Even with 16mb of memory it won't hold pictures of any size. And I never received the headphones which seems a plague from this seller. WTF? Do they open them up take out the buds and sell them on another site?

After using this phone in Thailand for the last couple months all I can say it works on 2 of the countries main mobile systems. Outside of that it is garbage. It overheats to the point you cannot hold it. The battery life is so short because I guess they felt the energy was better directed as a pocket heater. It constantly vibrates even when in call for no reason.

I MADE A MISTAKE BUYING THIS PHONE DON""T YOU DO HE SAME!!

The camera is terrible all this with the latest from Motorola. No wonder I have stuck with Samsung for the last 8 years. Now I will wait for the S7 to be available, that's Samsung!

Would I recommend this phone? NO WAY. There are way better products on the market. I have 3 Samsung Galaxies a S, S4 and a S5. All still working like a charm. This was the first time since the MotoRazor flip that I have bought a Motorola product. It will be my last!","2.0 out of 5 stars"

1. I purchased the 16 GB model straight from Motorola so the mileage will vary.
2. The specifications are wrong in the product description. The phone comes with a 13MP rear facing camera and a 5MP front facing camera.
Now with all of that out of the way, on to the review.

I have only had the phone for a day and all I can say is that this is a major improvement from the 1st and 2nd gen Moto Gs.

Pros:
Great cameras
Fast performance
Display
SD expandable (up to 32GB)
Compatible with most GSM carriers (This model is not compatible with Sprint or Verizon)
FM radio
Moto app

Takes about 4 hours to completely charge (it isn't too bad, just average)

The phone feels great in the hand, it responds almost instantaneously, haven't been able to force crash the phone even with 15 apps open in the background (although I do have 2GB of RAM instead of 1).
In the end, Motorola has created another great phone that lives up to the hype and reputation of the Moto G line. I would recommend buying the phone off of Motorola's website though instead of on Amazon.","5.0 out of 5 stars"

My Lumia 1520 died a month ago and I don't get an upgrade until April so I searched for a low priced phone I could use in the interim.  I am 100% satisfied with my decision to go with the Moto G.  The hardware runs Lollipop fantastically smooth and the phone will run all the apps I download for it.  Switching between apps is quick and painless as well.  The battery lasts all day even with me playing games, texting, responding to emails, and making calls.  The waterproof shell is outstanding!  I've cut the grass several times with this phone in my pocket and my Bluetooth headphones on and the phone becomes drenched in sweat.  It still functions perfectly fine which is a huge plus. The only complaint I have is that 8GB is not enough storage for my mobile device habits but that is totally on me for not buying the 16GB version.  I put an SD Card in it but a lot of apps still store content on the internal storage and a lot of apps do not let you move them to the SIM.  Again, this is on me, if I could go back I'd have probably paid extra for the 16GB version instead but I would have still gone with the Moto G!  Get it!  You won't be disappointed.","5.0 out of 5 stars"

The 4g LTE coverage on this phone eliminated my need for a signal booster, which was necessary to even use my old Galaxy S3 phone in my house.

I love that it's water resistant and it blows my mind that it actually has a working FM radio app that doesn't use data (it does require headphones to be used as the antenna).

Excellent phone right out of the box.  Looks great, functions flawlessly. I get that it's supposedly a ""Budget"" phone, but it functions like a Premium phone.

My smart phones have been the following:
Moto Q - Windows
HTC Touch Pro - Windows
Droid X
Droid RAZR (not the MAXX)
Galaxy S4

My first Moto was the best overall experience for the time.  It was consistent and predictable.  However, the X and RAZR were horrible, and I can probably blame a lot of that on the bloated updates that Verizon pushed out that made a mediocre phone a useless piece of junk.  I can say the same for the GS4.  All of these generally were better suited as a pocket heater than a phone.  I would have gone back to that Q if I could have.

As my contract expired with Verizon, I was looking at my options.I swore I would never buy another Motorola product again, but after looking at what is out there, I couldn't help but come back to the Moto G3.  I can't justify the $600 price of a ""flagship"" Samsung, and honestly didn't need the overhead of Knox.  I also use my phone as a corporate device, so because of MDM policies, I'm not a rooter.  The balance of features on this phone for the price was undeniable.

At the time of purchase, there was a price drop on the Moto X 2014, but I can't own a phone without SD expansion (bye bye Samsung). So, I ordered the 16/2GB for me and my wife.  Two phones for less than the price of one flagship.  I've also dumped Verizon and went to Cricket.  Again, it's a balance of cost/function.

The unboxing was standard, with nothing exciting (as it should be, it's just a box you throw away).  I powered it up and immediately updated both to Marshmallow and performed a FDR.

Pros:
PURE ANDROID - NO CARRIER BLOAT!!!!
Phone is perfectly responsive.
Multi tasking is excellent.
I get a full day of usage without even trying. (unlike GS4)
Zero screen glitches/lag. (unlike GS4)
When I pick up my phone it is COLD to the touch. (unlike GS4)
Front-facing speaker eliminates the old hand-cup trick. (unlike GS4)

Cons:
There is a software feature by Motorola that decreases ringtone for the first 2 seconds, due to a front-facing speaker.  This was needed on the G1 and G2 as there was only one speaker and it was to prevent someone going deaf if a call came in while holding it up to their ear.  Since it has two speakers, I don't see this as necessary.  I hope Motorola sends out an update to allow users to disable it.  This makes Facebook messenger pop notifications silent (as FB identifies their notifications as a ringtone and not a notification).
No Gyro means no Google Cardboard.
No NFC
non-replaceable battery
Slow charging (Even with my Anker fast-chargers)
Wi-Fi connectivity issues with Cisco APs. (See update below)

So, again, for the price, the pros heavily outweigh the cons and I feel that this phone is a definite upgrade over my GS4.

Motorola, you have redeemed yourself with this phone.  It appears that the changes made by Google were successful and I hope that Lenovo continues that push.

***Moto, please fix the ringtone and allow a few more milliamps while charging (Snapdragon 410 supports Quick Charge 2.0).  These are both software changes and would leave me super-impressed.  I know you don't want to compete with your X platform with Turbo, but a slight uplift in charging wouldn't hurt.

Update:
After a couple months of use, I have discovered a Wi-Fi connectivity issue with commercial grade Cisco devices such as the Aironet line. There will be issues from not being able to obtain an IP address to random drops with no ability to reconnect. Hundreds of other devices from Samsung to Apple mobile products and various laptops have no issues at these sites. Moto escalated support has been very responsive, but no fix. I believe that it is a problem for both Moto and Cisco to fix together, but that's not going to happen.","5.0 out of 5 stars"

TL;DR: I miss the ability to unlock my phone with a finger print. That's  the only feature I miss from the iPhone 6. Otherwise, I don't feel like I'm skimping on anything having left the iPhone 6.  Android Marshmallow's facial recognition to unlock the phone is good, but does not work in all light conditions - so I really miss this.

LONGER REVIEW:
First, I am not experiencing any of the screen or Bluetooth issues others report here. I am using an AT&T GoPhone SIM card and no issues with call quality, line dropping etc. I've connected this phone to a wide array of devices: my Toyota's built in BT; my PS Audio Sprout amp; a portable BT speaker; my Macbook Pro etc. No issues at all. That's just not happening to me.

Screen: it can be made bright, but also like the built-in ambient light setting that will adjust the screen brightness based on the ambient light in the room. Sometimes I override this and crank up the brightness when necessary.

Ergonomic design: overall, phone feels comfortable in my hand. I got a slim-fitting case to protect against drops, and it still feels good to hold.

Functionality: Well, this really depends on whether your like Android OS or not. I personally think Android has come a hell of a long way since it's introduction.  I'd go as far as saying Android actually surpasses iOS in some areas.
But more importantly, I will give Motorola Mobility props for keeping the OTA operating system updates coming.
I bought this phone Nov. 2015 and the Marshmallow update came in early February -- I feared not getting any updates after purchasing this phone since Google sold this division to Lenovo. Hope to keep seeing the updates coming.

I personally have no issues with Android - and in fact, I use my phone for more media consumption than my old iPad 2. I use a Macbook Pro and there are times I don't want to lug around and open up a computer to browse the web. This phone gets a major workout EVERYDAY by me and it has never let me down.  Having said that, you can double-tap the home button to see all apps running and kill those you don't need to save memory and battery cycles. But overall UI response is fast and snappy.

Battery life for me has been good -- I can get at least a day and half between charges. However, I also of in the habit of turning off WiFi and Bluetooth if they are not needed. I also run my screen at the halfway point most of the time (and no, I don't feel like I am sacrificing legibility doing that).

I haven't had to find out how important the waterproofing is, but I'm glad it is.

Misc. Cons:
No NFC - so no Android Pay (not in widespread use here in the U.S. anyway, so don't feel like I'm missing out)
Android phone styles overall are a bit generic, and the Moto G is no different in this regard, but not a huge issue to me. Function is more important than form in my book.
Camera could be better: it's great for bright light situations, not so much for low light (expect grain in your bar room selfies ;-)
Like iCloud on iOS, Google Photos will automatically sync pictures to the cloud for storage and sharing with others. My wife is still on an iPhone 6, and I installed the Google Photos app on her phone -- now our photos are always in sync!

That's all for now -- I'll edit this review if something crops up.
But for now, totally glad I got this phone -- it's great value for the price and I do not feel like I took a step down when I left the iPhone 6.
This may not be Motorola's flagship phone (that'd be the Moto X Pure edition probably), but it's a damn good phone and one I would recommend to friends and coworkers.","4.0 out of 5 stars"

I have had this phone for about 6 months and each day it works less and less now its to the point where I cannot even use it. I am very disappointed as I thought this phone would be good due to the great review and research done. Worth spending a bit more for something that works well and will keep working well as time pushes forward.

 If you do anything more than call and text on this phone, consider other options. You can use simple tasks but if you want to use Instagram, or any other social media app this will not effectively get the job done. Oh, and talk about lack of storage, the phones software uses about half the storage as it comes and with any additional photos, videos, apps, forget about it. Yes you can put an external storage but most apps don't transfer to an outside media. This phone is the worst, move along.","1.0 out of 5 stars"

The Moto G looks like a much more expensive phone, and the 3rd generation design clearly takes its inspiration from the latest iPhones. I am very pleased with the speed and responsiveness of the latest Android version as well. Migrating all my data from my previous phone was surprisingly easy.

Now for the bad part. There is a really horrible, unforgivable bug in the software version that comes pre-installed with this phone that will drive you insane. This phone CANNOT make phone calls or receive texts out of the box. Pretty horrible for a phone to not function as a phone. You would think that the geniuses at Motorola would have tested that first. Thankfully, a system update was all it took to fix the issue, but that bug cost me a day of phone service and hours of anger and confusion, as I thought it was an issue with my SIM card or my carrier. Apparently this is an issue with the firmware, so I will wave my middle finger straight at Motorola on this one.

Otherwise, the Moto G is a dream. It's everything I need it to be and the latest OS, Android 6, throws in a lot of nice-to-have bells and whistles. I think this is the best smart phone for your money on the market. Just wish they tested the damn firmware better.","4.0 out of 5 stars"

One of the reasons I love this phone is because of the quality of the pictures, and that is one of the reasons I bought it. The only drawback is the internal memory which doesn't allow to download many apps and take lots of pictures, but it can be solved pretty easily as you can buy a SD card as an external storage space. You can also set up the phone to automatically back up your pictures on Google pictures so that you can always access them and still take pictures.","5.0 out of 5 stars"

Other offerings like the Asus Zenfone 2 come with their own offerings, but may present their own caveats (for the aforementioned example, bloat and a lack of expandable storage). And there's a lot to love about the Moto G; it's super zippy, it's water resistant, the camera is better than it deserves to be on a phone in this price bracket, and the only thing I can point to where I can say ""that's where they cut the price"" is in the lack of extras like a gyrometer or NFC functionality. Honestly, it's the best phone a person should be able to ask for given the price.
That being said, the gap between these lower mid tier phones and high end phones got a whole lot smaller since the Moto G came out, and spending just a bit more on a better device may be a better option. To put it into perspective, the newly freely purchasable One Plus X costs thirty dollars more and comes with a full 1080p display, NFC, better build quality, a gyrometer, and a significantly faster CPU (though with stock Android on the Moto G, you probably won't notice much of a performance gap with regular day to day use, even with the Snapdragon 410 inside the Moto). The story is similar with slightly older, yet still entirely capable and massively discounted devices, such as the Nexus 5 or the LG G3. What I'm saying is that this phone fits into a specific niche for people who abosuletly can't spend any more than $220, and can deal with some of the downsides like a lower quality display (720p is still fine at 290 something PPI, though you can still see the grid of pixels if you look close enough or at an angle) and don't mind the lack of graphical horsepower or gyrometer (for things like Google Cardboard). It's a good, solid phone, but Moto's history of dominance in the budget phone market is quickly being encroached upon, and there are better out there. That all being said, the 2015 Moto G is still a good deal that's well worth the price, just make sure to shop around a little before you decide to buy.","5.0 out of 5 stars"

This phone is ready to connect to 4G LTE networks which is great. Nice 5"" HD display. Very straight forward UI.
 1.4GHz Quad core processor. Nice for multitasking.

I was a bit confused by the description for this listing because it mentioned a VGA front facing camera. My packaging didn't mention VGA. 13 MP rear camera with color correcting temperature and dual LED flash.
Pretty decent shots from this phone! As with most phone cameras, as long as you have good lighting and a steady hand you should be able to grab some nice shots.
The flash is not too overpowering but provides some nice light in low light situations without turning you into a ghost.

Not sure if it's because of putting a protective case onto the device but it Does seem to heat up with extended use.

Overall it's a solid little unlocked smartphone that is great for travel.

Box included phone, charger, and a booklet.","4.0 out of 5 stars"

Pros:
- no nonsense phone with all the features I need.
- recognizes gestures (for example if it's sitting on the table and locked, as soon as you moved it, it shows the clock)
- water proof: I can listed to music while taking a shower (I would not recommend dumping in the hot tub though)
- stick into it a 64GB microsd and have no storage problems
Cons:
- it sometimes lags and I notice memory usage is above 80% when many apps are open at the same time. Perhaps the 2 GB Ram version would not suffer such issues, but IMHO is not worth the extra $50","4.0 out of 5 stars"

Over the years, I've had a ton of Android phones (including a Moto X, Nexus 5, Galaxy Nexus, and currently a Nexus 5X), and I've never been more satisfied than with this Moto G. There is limited bloat (aside from a few Moto add ons, it's nearly ""pure""), the size is comfortable, the speed is more than enough to satisfy, and - it's waterproof (I wash mine all the time now).

I've recently upgraded to an LG Nexus 5X, and I am really missing the Moto G. The smaller size was more comfortable, and I do not notice a performance upgrade on the 5X that is significant.

It replaced a 2 year old Samsung Galaxy 4, which had started deteriorating after 18 mos., as had my previous Android flagship phone. Since I am moving to an MVNO, I didn't want to spend the $$ for another flagship. While I'm probably not a power user, I'm self-employed and my cell phone is the only phone I have, for both personal and business use. I do lots of web surfing, SMS/MMS, view some videos on the phone, track packages, etc.

So far, I'm impressed with this handset. It doesn't feel cheap. It's a little heavier and thicker than my Galaxy, but also has a 1/2"" larger screen top to bottom. Love the lack of bloatware and I like Motorola's add-ons, like Motorola Migration to help move files from old phone to new, and the availability of their online system to lock, wipe, or change a passcode.

Screen resolution is fine. Camera, in my limited use so far, is fine. I haven't yet shot video, which I do quite a bit on a phone, so can't comment on that. Battery life and responsiveness are better than my 2 year old Samsung, though that's to be expected.

All in all, I'm a fan.","5.0 out of 5 stars"

Real Android (5.1.1 as of last update), great screen, good call quality (all cellphones aren't that good), excellent connectivity on WiFi and 4G. Works GREAT with Cricket Wireless. I get 4G LTE in strong signal areas, HSPA in my home which has a fair to poor signal. Calls always go through just fine, even in my low signal home.

I selected Cricket Wireless as my carrier, and bought the BYOP kit from Amazon. Works great, but read the caution below. Solution is to make sure you buy a MicroSIM kit for BYOP.

The only caution is that the box has an icon showing Micro SIM OK, nanoSIM Bad!. Googling this, I found that the electrical contacts for the SIM slot can catch on NonoSIM to MicroSIM adapters if the SIM card is removed. This is the case for me, since I chose Cricket Wireless (ATT Prepaid) as my carrier. Since I don't intend to remove the SIM, it isn't a big problem. Knowing about the problem, should I need to remove the SIM (to change carriers, for example), I will need to take care extracting the Cricket NanoSIM. You can google the method, which is not complicated, and is essentially slipping a very thin piece of plastic (like screen protector plastic) into the SIM slot before gently removing the NanoSIM","5.0 out of 5 stars"

  I tend not to use the data plan much.  Easy to turn off or on.  Wi-Fi works very well.  The integrated Google apps and voice control are nice features.  Phone can be setup to allow notifications (new texts, missed calls, calendar appointments, weather alerts, etc.) to show on the screen when the phone is locked.
  Have had the phones for almost a month and still learning.  Marshmallow Android was pushed out by Motorola with no apparent glitches.  Had to update a lot of apps but the phone took care of most of it after asking for permission tor each app update.

This was my first smart phone. I made my last feature phone last about 10 yrs. That said, the phone had a lot of great reviews about being the best value entry level smart phone and ideal for new users and that seems to me to be true. It seems very well built and substantial. It functions very quickly and isn't glitchy. It has a lot of nice features that seem above and beyond what it needs to have for the price. Camera is quite good, especially for a sub-$200 phone. The flashlight function is great for a dog owner, out late at night. Especially being able to access it with just a shake. It holds a charge very well. Actual phone call quality is good. Overall size seems optimal for viewing things but not taking up too much space in hand or pocket.
Some of the functions are not particularly intuitive for a first-timer like me. Adding/editing contacts, for one.
Can't go into tremedous detail, but it seems to me to be an excellent phone and value. When I brought it into the T-Mobile store to sync up to my account, the sales guy seemed impressed/surprised with it as he worked with it. He wasn't familiar with it because they don't sell it.","4.0 out of 5 stars"

Immediately after receiving the phone yesterday, I opened the package, turned the phone on, and started to explore its features and capabilities.

My first impressions: I really liked the design (it is small enough for one hand yet large enough to view everything comfortably and rather thin and light) and the display (sharp for a 720p screen). Coming from iOS and not using Android except to help my family to troubleshoot their devices, I found the layout intuitive and easy to navigate. The phone seemed responsive enough and was enjoying the experience so after less than one hour of use I inserted a new SIM and called my service provider to activate the phone.

After getting off the phone, approximately one hour after opening the Moto G, I noticed a thin bright blue line running vertically the full length of the screen---I assumed defective pixels. I immediately called Motorola support. The tech advised me to return the phone and transferred me over to customer service. I could barely understand the rep not only because of a poor connection (it was obviously overseas) but also b/c English was not her native language. After much deciphering she told me that I had 2 choices: they could sent me a refurbished phone immediately and place a small charge on my credit card which would be refunded when the defective phone was returned, or pay $24.99 to have the phone I just received repaired. When I reiterated that I had just received this brand new phone merely an hour ago and that I was shocked that they would not send me a new phone to replace it, she merely restated what I was already told.

I hung up and called another customer service rep to be absolutely certain that what I was told by first rep was truly the company policy. Again this rep was difficult to understand and the connection poor (another overseas call) but gave me the exact same choices as the first rep.

I then went to Motorola.com and requested a total refund. There was no way I was paying money to fix a defective phone and I hadn't ordered and purchased a new phone only to get stuck with a refurbished one (no one offered me a reduction in price to tempt me). Their policy makes no sense. I just now ordered an Alcatel Idol 3 to try so hopefully have better luck.

Oh.....another thing possibly found......my SIM got activated and I can access the info on my carriers website but the Moto G is not reading it at all. It is a brand new SIM so I am not sure if the problem lies with the SIM card itself or the Moto G. Because I read another review of someone having problems with the SIM card, I'm more suspicous it is the Moto G. I will try to update this review when I get the new phone to verify if it is the phone.

UPDATE 10/9/15: I put the SIM in my new Alcatel Idol 3 and it worked. I did clean the SIM card beforehand with alcohol so who knows. But, in hindsight I am so glad I got a defective phone because I am absolutely loving the Idol 3! The display is the biggest difference--so much better than the Moto G for nearly the same price. I wasn't sure about the bigger size but I'm actually enjoying a bit more screen for viewing.","1.0 out of 5 stars"

So once this sinks in, many will eventually realize that most don't really NEED phones in the $500-$850 range.  Enter the Moto G.

First it's important for people to realize that there are two variations of this newest model (3rd generation).  For around $179 you have a version that has 8 gigs of built-in storage, and for around $229, you have one that has 16 gigs of built-in storage.  Both will allow you to add up to a 32 gig micro SD card to add to that (some report success using higher capacity cards, others report glitches).  There is one other rarely advertised difference, though - the 16 gig version comes with TWO (2) gigs of RAM, while the 8 gig version only comes with ONE (1) gig of RAM.  RAM allows you to multitask more apps, speeds up app opening and closing a bit, and can in some cases help some with certain types of video use.  So, should you splurge on the model with more RAM?  Maybe - see below...

I first tried out the lesser of the two models and it did fine with everyday tasks like talking, texting, checking Facebook/Twitter, etc.  But when I tried a more intensive app like Periscope (a video social media app), I noticed the phone at times, sporadically, sputtered and occasionally a green 'flash' would appear on my video broadcasts that both I and those watching me, could see.  I also noticed that the 'available' internal memory was just under 4 gigs of the 8 claimed, due to the OS and other things pre-installed.  So, I took it back and instead ordered this one, with more internal memory and that extra gig of RAM.  I can see a difference.  Apps open fractionally faster, Periscope video broadcasts flow flawlessly, and it just has a more ""smooth"" operating feel than the lesser spec version - though again, for people who ONLY want a phone for basic social media, email, etc... the $179 version of this phone would probably be fine.

The 5 inch 720p screen is bright and detailed.  The 13 megapixel rear camera is leaps better than previous Moto models, though not quite as good as flagship phones upon full sized inspection.  But since 85% of people who take photos with their cell phones rarely (if ever) actually print them, much less print them in larger sizes, I really don't think this is going to be an issue for most people.  The photos are still nice and details in decent to good light - suffering from noise/grain a bit once the light goes down.  The front facing 5 megapixel camera is very capable and detailed, but lets in slightly less light than those from the higher dollar flagship phones - in other words, you may need more light in the room when doing those selfies or video chats.  Battery life is fine - if you're a VERY heavy user you're going to top-up before the day is done, but for low to medium users you should make it through the day. Adding to this is splash-resistance, so that helps if you get caught in the rain... just don't submerge it.

Mine was the unlocked version and I installed a Tracfone GSM micro sim card in it and it worked just fine.  It should work equally as well with AT&T and T-mobile sims but I'm told it will also work with the likes of Verizon sim cards too - I wasn't able to test that, though.

PROS:  Affordable. Good screen for price. Updates to Android 6.0.  Decent battery life.  Improved cameras over previous models.  Micro SD card capable.  Speedy and fast (especially the $229 version with the extra RAM).

CONS:  Volume buttons are in the middle-center of the right side, so for some, this is where you grip the phone, causing possible accidental button pushes - once you get a decent case on it, it stiffens that area up some and helps remove the problem.  Rounded shape of back creates a 'rocking' motion if you try to lay it flat on a table and text that way.","4.0 out of 5 stars"

This is my second time trying the Moto G. My first phone only lasted about 6 months before I started having issues such as apps not working correctly, freezing up and over all battery issues (don't hold long) just to name a few. I had high hopes for the third addition hoping it would be better. First day, I had issues such as not showing up when a voice mail comes in and texts not showing up on my first day with the phone. I gave it a chance and kept it a little long. Within the 4th day I started getting issues with text again not showing up at all. I called Moto for help and they wanted me to clear the cash and rebot the entire system to factor settings and try again. I felt like saying is this AOL, LOL it was the answer anytime AOL had a problem was to take the software off and reinstall it.

I returned it back and have decided to look at other phones including Windows phones. With so much fragmentation it is upsetting not to get the new software when it comes out that is why I took a chance on the Moto G again since it is pure google. I know many people who love this phone and have no issues I wish I was one of them as I do like the phone in general. I would not recommend getting this phone.","2.0 out of 5 stars"

This newer model is not only quite a bit snappier, the 2GB of RAM in the 16GB model is key, do NOT purchase the slightly less expensive 8GB model.  The 16GB model not only gives you twice the storage for photos and apps, the 2GB of RAM will noticeably improve the performance of your phone when you have quite a few apps running.

The water resistance feature is a bonus.

Overall, great value.  A fine balance between cheap Android phones that disappoint and a super expensive phone that will make you cry when it is lost/stolen/broken.","5.0 out of 5 stars"

Also, the newist Moto G's have an issue with ONLY T-Mobile's LTE 4G service, simply switch phone to 3G in settings or allow the phones upgrade to android 6 to proceed to resolve of using T-Mobile.","5.0 out of 5 stars"

The plastic shell on the back of the phone does not seal properly around the ""bottom corner hole"" (as it is described in the user manual). This is the point where you use your finger nail to pry off shell, and they specifically say to not ""use tools to remove the cover"" but that it may require a ""little muscle."" I don't know if it was loose out of the box, but when I pried off the back to insert the micro SIM and microSD cards and replaced the shell I noticed that it would not click securely closed at the bottom corner hole. I don't know if it's because of a fault in the shell or in the body of the phone (I'd assume it's a problem with the shell as the nub that fits into the back of the phone body is slightly shorter than the one on the opposite side). I have tried a number of times to replace the back shell with no luck securing this one corner. The shell is relatively secure, and obviously this doesn't affect the phone's functionality. However, the water resistance requires a tight seal. I have ordered a replacement shell to determine if it is a fault with the shell or the body of the phone. I'll update when I receive the shell.

Update: 8/19/2015
I purchased a replacement shell directly from Motorola ($14.99 + $5 shipping), and the shell snapped securely closed at the bottom corner. The problem appears to reside in the shell that I received with the phone, and not the body of the phone. I would caution repeatedly taking the shell off as the nubs that snap into the body could become worn down. This entire review has been about the shell, the one complaint I've had. In the week I've been using this phone, I've been extremely happy with the phone's performance (smooth transitions between applications), the practically pure Android lollipop experience (5.1.1), and long battery life (easily a full day including video conferencing for ~1 hr). I'm upgrading the rating to 5 stars from 4 (my true score would have always been somewhere in between), and I would strongly recommend this phone to anyone interested in getting a new Android phone at a budget price.","5.0 out of 5 stars"

I read several reviews comparing the Moto G 3rd to the Galaxy 6 and iphone 6, and the price difference was the big selling point for me.  In fact, my out-of-pocket cost was only $37.60 plus $196.00 from credit card rewards, and I am using a low cost monthly pay-as-you-go carrier service.  Now that I have noticed friends with clunky thick and small screen older generation smart phones, I am even more pleased with my up-to-date Moto G 3rd at a price savings of $400.00 or more.","5.0 out of 5 stars"

Going that route is actually pretty nice since it allows you to customize the colors of the front, back, and camera accent piece.

I switched over from an HTC One M7 and couldn't be happier. It gets reception in areas where my previous phone didn't, has ridiculously long battery life, and is much smoother to use (on paper, the processor isn't as good, but the lack of bloatware makes up for it in terms of performance).

The only software additions that Motorola has are genuinely thoughtful, like the motion gestures (chop twice to activate flashlight, twist twice to activate camera) and Moto Display. With Moto Display, the phone can tell when you pick it up from a table or your pocket, and gives a quick, battery-friendly view of the time and any notifications you might have, all without having to press the unlock button. From there you can choose to unlock into the app with the notification, unlock to the home screen, or ignore it and it'll go away after a couple seconds.

The heavy-duty water resistance is a nice touch as well; combine this phone with a durable case and I think it will last a very long time. For anyone who doesn't use their phone for heavy graphics-intensive gaming, I don't think it would be possible to go wrong with this one.","5.0 out of 5 stars"

Tests on YouTube show no discernible differences in responsiveness between this and the 2GB version. I wouldn't have wanted this screen and somewhat budget features for over $200. At $180 (I paid $150 for a like new) it's a good deal for a good Android experience that will only get better with 6.0.

The storage does go fast but I still have a solid 2GB of space for updates and eventualities. Android 6.0 will allow for better offloading to an SD card of apps and app related junk. Long overdue. And I expect that update to come before the end of the year, if not the end of October. Perfectly fine for people who want/need a logical amount of apps. Not for the person who needs 100-plus apps.

Get the 16GB model. It only has about 5 GBs of usable memory. 3 of the 8 is taken up by the OS. And memory will fill up fast on this phone, especially with how heavy today's apps are. And once this phone gets to filling up, it slows down, a lot. When I first got the phone it performed beautifully. Now it struggles and crawls to open apps. When apps finally do open they are sluggish and crash constantly. I'm also constantly going into the storage management to delete caches and other useless data just so the phone can work again. Really wish they were more open with how much memory this phone actually had. Its a really good phone when it works, but most of the time it's is really too sluggish to use.

The Good:
-Great phone for the price!
-Nice 5"" screen, not superb, but very very nice quality and colors
-Good loud speaker, even if it only has one (why would you need stereo speakers on a cellphone anyway?)
-Battery life is enough to get you through your day in a normal usage: email, chat,calls, a bit of gaming, a bit of video, a bit of surfing, a bit of everything,
-Camera takes good quality pictures (better than the old moto g 2013)
-Almost Vanilla Android, with no bloatware, just a couple of apps from motorola that they are actually usefull!
-Guaranteed upgrades: Old moto g1 got lollipop and it runs smoothly. The 3rd gen moto runs lollipop 5.1.1 and runs very very smooth, no lag so far
-Moto maker!
-Micro sd card up to 32GB helps out with your memory (there some websites saying that they have tested 64GB microSD and working ""fine"", however, i would go for the 32 just to be safe)
-Water resistance!

The bad:
-8GB is nothing, you'll get about 4GB, almost 5GB of free memory to install apps, phone cache, etc. Go for the 16GB and 2GB RAM version, you will tell the difference
-Yep, 720 by today standards is pretty much acceptable, but 1080 would have been much appreciated...however i understand that is all about price.
-Stock camera app wont let you change the pixels size of the picture, but there are workarounds for that
-No Gyro (although personally i dont care)

All in all, it is a great phone either for beginner or advanced user. Don't get confused about the snapdragon 410, it is a 64 bit processor more than capable to take on any app that you can throw at (Yes, moto g1 had a snapdragon 400, but it was 32bit, there's a difference)

Something i noticed, when using the 4G network, my phone used to get a little warm when watching videos (youtube, netflix) or surfing heavy sites (not much, just a bit warm), however, turned back to 3G/H+ and the warm decreased a lot! I know some people might think ""well that's a huge stepback, going from 4G to 3G/H+"", but...really? how often do we really use 4G? Pretty much everywhere we go, work, home, friend's home, restaurant, caffé, they all have WiFi...the only time not using WiFi is during car travel, and if you are using yourphone while driving...just be careful...

To wrap it up, you wont regret getting this phone. I dont give 5 stars because nothing is perfect.","4.0 out of 5 stars"

I liked that phone, but over time, with the firmware updates and increased demands from apps, along with only 8gb of internal memory, it had clearly run its course.

The Moto G (3rd Gen) is fantastic. The extra gig of RAM is obvious. There is almost no lag moving from one app to another. The LTE speeds are clearly present (sometimes I felt that the 1st gen was actually faster at 3G) and browsing is incredible.  The screen is the perfect size. It is smaller than a phablet but larger than the 4.7"" phones I've had over the years.

The camera is nice. Moving objects can still blur, but nothing like what the 5mp camera on the 1st gen had.  Still pictures are crisp and beautiful.

I can stream music (Google Music, Pandora, TuneIn) and run my GPS navigation with no lag.

Areas for improvement:  I would love to see NFC technology added to the next gen Moto G (or whatever branding Lenovo goes with).  I would also like to see some kind of finger print tech, though that is probably another year or two from being affordable on the low end phones. Android Pay is the future of point of sale transactions, and I think it will become increasingly necessary, even in budget phones.","5.0 out of 5 stars"

It fell in the pool and survived but only barely. I tried Moto E 2nd gen, but the resolution was too bad, and the camera deplorable.
This phone, hits a sweet spot. Cheaper than the 2nd gen Moto G, and with a much better camera, and slightly snappier performance. It's a little larger, which is alright. Actually it's a pretty nice size, about the same as an iPhone 5, though a bit thicker and heavier.
I've already dropped it once, and not a scratch and no screen damage. Cool.
As I mentioned, pretty good camera.

Anyways this a great phone guys.. It's really quick, it rarely lags I have the 1gb version but its more than enough for snapchats, Facebook and more. Camera is really good in bright scenarios, at night not so much. Snapchats look amazing on this phone I was honestly impressed. And the built quality is great a bit on the plastic side but feels solid, the screen is bright. You don't need more than 720p it looks great to me and it helps the battery a ton although it takes awhile to charge. So make sure you charge before bed, but the battery lasts a lot. It's a great buy! It does more than enough for everyday needs and more. Im cla college kid whos always on the phone abd im telling this phone is amazing.

Intuitive android interface, tons of camera features, solid battery life, beautiful Gorilla screen, water resistant, perfect intermediate size (not obnoxiously big or too small), etc.

I personally wouldn't pay 180 for the 8 gig version, due to the fact that I don't like overpaying for phones in general with the risk of theft, loss, or damage, and b/c the gigs included get cut to like 5, but if you can get it on sale, it's still a steal.  Easily the best, most feature-rich phone I've ever owned, and best of all it's unlocked.  The audio for me was the big initial selling point - front speakers, GREAT audio.  Also BLAZING internet speed thanks in part also due to T-MOBILE's LTE.

I will say the reason it's not 5 stars is simple - I had to swap it out 3 TIMES b/c there was tons of confusion initially about why call audio wasn't working upon use - turns out you need to do a system update for 30 MINUTES in order to upgrade to Marshmallow.  Pain in the ass, and wasted a whole day.  Motorola customer service is s***, took hours to figure it out.  T-Mobile didn't know, and Best Buy associate FINALLY figured it out.

Also - you WILL need to download additional apps b/c some of the pre-programmed apps aren't great (such as dialer, clock, media app, etc), and also android doesn't allow you to relocate a ton of apps/data to an SD card on this phone, so that's a con for me as well.  Lastly, Motorola doesn't include a USB for some freakin reason.  That drops the score down a bit b/c that's an accessory you'll have to pay out of pocket for - shame on them for that, most companies now include that for free...utterly ridiculous.

UPDATE: Upgraded to 16 gig/ 2 gig ram  version for a total of $130.00 through Best Buy price match haggling.  Which really IS the steal of the year.  I did so b/c I now believe the 8 gig version, which a nice entry level phone with tons of bonuses, just doesn't provide nearly enough basic ROM necessary to use long-term.  Those 8 gigs turn into 4.5, and after app upgrades, apps, games, media, etc. - well...you get the picture.  And don't even think about getting an SD card for anything other than media - ANDROID doesn't allow to you migrate ANYTHING to them (basically).  So for me, it became 16 gig or bust.  And I'm quite happy with it, aside from a steeper learning curve than I expected (such as having to find apps to sync contacts from old Windows Phone)

2ND UPDATE: Screen does get smudgy with fingerprints, not ideal.  Also, while the battery life is outstanding, the charging time is HORRENDOUSLY slow (like 5 hours for a full charge).

FINAL CONCLUSION:

I've compared this phone to others in the 200$ category, and there's really this, and a few others like the Zenfone and One Touch Idol 3, but that's about it.  As an example - Samsung Grand Prime (somehow gets good reviews?) is a HORRIBLE phone.  Audio is CRAP, not to mention the bloatware.  Right there I knew to skip it.  If you can't enjoy videos/music on your phone, that's a big, immediate no-no from me.  Moto G has some of the best speakers on the market today.  At similar price points, you might get a slightly better processor and screen/camera, but you won't get the well-rounded variety the Moto G provides - water resistance WITH a dual facing, 13/5mpixel camera AND 4GLTE capability; better than advertised real-world processing capability, Gorilla Glass, and Micro SD option.

4/5.

Moto G 3rd gen 16gb isn't perfect, but has a little bit of everything, making for a unique intermediate mobile.","4.0 out of 5 stars"

I'm completely thrilled with the build quality, snappiness, and overall performance of the phone.  Stock android is also definitely the way to go.  I was worried about 1GB of RAM not being sufficient, but with the light use I put this phone through on a daily basis, it isn't an issue. It's worth mentioning that the iPhone 6 only has 1GB.

However, my phone's SD card was non-functioning which I smoothly initiated an RMA for over their website. FYI there are two RMA options.

1. Print a pre paid shipping label and ship your phone in. Upon receiving, Motorola will issue a replacement phone.
2. Pay $25 (non refundable) and a $100 deposit (refundable) fee and Motorola will ship you a replacement phone and you ship your phone in at your own time. Why anyone would sink more money into this is beyond me.

A week and a half after shipping my phone, I received package. It was my original phone without any repairs made. On top of that, the phone was damaged.

This time I called and requested escalation. The escalation department was not able to offer anything more than the original RMA system. I also had to  Despite talking to the supervisor, they were unable to offer compensation or remove fees for option 2. Effectively the escalation department serves no purpose and customer service does not exist beyond the most basic tier.

TLDR: Customer service is very basic. You can add Motorola to your list of bad companies like Comcast.

Update Nov 9th: Second RMA returned again with nothing fixed. This time I had left notes on the RMA saying what the problems are. I also included a business card with the symptoms written out. Again I was not contacted before they returned my original phone with no repair made.","1.0 out of 5 stars"

Most of the reviews covered the phone in general so I am not going to discuss the phone itself in depth in this review except for two quick things.

1. One thing that I find annoying about this phone is that it doesnt sit flat on surfaces because of the curved design on the back. The phone will wobble or spin around if you try to use it on a flat surface. Consider getting a case that will allow it to sit flat on surfaces.

2. You should seriously consider the 16gb storage / 2gb RAM model. This is the model I got. On average my phone uses about 1.1GB of memory. I included a screenshot of the memory consumption of my phone. Also, after installing all necessary apps the phone storage space sits at 9.75gb out of 16gb. So you need to decide if the extra $33 is worth it. I included a couple screenshots of the space limitations of this phone.

Camera
I am very pleased with the camera's performance. I got this phone mainly because I didnt want to carry around a camera and a cell phone all the time. I needed to get a new phone but didnt want to pay the price for an LG or iPhone. I find the camera to perform exceptionally well. While there are limitations in the camera app, there are other cool camera apps that could be downloaded that allow for more features.

All the photos attached to this review were taken with the native camera app that came with the phone. The HDR component does an exceptional job in taking outdoor photos.

Flash / Low Light
I took a couple pictures comparing indoor shots with and without a flash. The images are labelled accordingly. I am still not sure about indoor photos and the quality of the flash. In some photos, I felt that the flash sometimes makes the picture look worse. I think this is an overall issue with all smartphones. In very dark situations the quality with a flash was acceptable.

Outdoor
I am very impressed with the quality of the outdoor photos. I really think the photos came out much sharper with the Moto G than with my Panasonic Lumix camera. The camera uses HDR technology which ensures that all elements of the photo come out sharp by taking multiple shots and combining them together for one sharp photo. This means that the image size will much larger when using HDR. This is something else to consider. The non-HDR photos were around 2mb each whereas the HDR images were around 5-6mb each. Included are some really nice landscape and flower shots.

One more thing. The phone recently had a hard fall after I tripped on the stairs (yes I was looking at my phone. I know, I know). This was the second time it fell or perhaps thrown to the hard stone ground. I had the thin clear Pleson case with the Pleson screen protector and the phone didnt have a scratch. The first time it had no case but it did have the Pleson screen protector. It fell scree face down from the table on to a ceramic tiled floor and nothing happened to the screen. Dont waste your money on a bulky otterbox style case. Not needed.","4.0 out of 5 stars"

Now I was looking to use this one for a long time so I bought the 2 GB RAM version because I know it's more than worth it. Here's a succinct review;

Good stuff:
-Really good phone for its price,
-This one feels right, not very big and not tiny either, it fits your jeans back pocket,
-A battery that feels eternal in comparison with other brands,
-Great back camera, good frontal camera,
-Compatible with literally every app on the play store,
-Easy to set up,
-Pretty good antenna,
-Bought a slim case and a tempered glass, it's fallen a few times from a low height and it's just as new. It hasn't been kicked by a calf or run by a tractor yet, hope it doesn't happen though,
-Good at taking cattle pictures (had to put it out there, sorry)

Pet peeves:
-No notification light, but the Moto Display software makes up for it somewhat.
-Currently has a serious problem recognizing contacts phone numbers (reject installing marshmallow 6.0, as the problem stems from that update, or delete and re-enter your contact synced accounts after it's done)

Overall, you can't go wrong with this one as there's no ugly feature in it.","5.0 out of 5 stars"

The screen brightness, size, and price make it great.  I was deciding between this and the Zenfone 2.

I picked this Moto G (3rd gen XT1540), because of the usability and price.

The performance is good, and the phone doesn't lag.

I'm sitting, writing this review, and can't really find any major negatives, for the price/performance ratio.
The one slight issue I had, which was probably user error on my part, was getting the cover off the 1st time.
2nd time I did it it was a bit easier.

While you can get a better faster phone, with a 4k cam, and all the buzz tech., the price to features ration won't be as good as this.
For those of us which have got out of the subsidized phone game, with a high overall cost, the Moto G 3rd Gen makes a great choice.

Conclusion:
Good screen, performance and price.","5.0 out of 5 stars"

I bought this phone 5 days before leaving for 22 days in China.  I had just sent my awful LG G3 to Ft Worth for its 3rd attempt at repair and was without a phone.  This little gem had me asking why I ever bought the G3.  By the way, to hopefully save you some trouble, don't buy LG. Their products are shady and their service is despicable. They absolutely refused to replace or reimburse me for my malfunctioning G3--all software related.  Instead they took three swings at repairing it and it still doesn't work right.

But enough of that.  I wanted to praise this wonderful phone. Build quality is very nice. It feels and looks expensive. I'm not exaggerating when I say that the camera is SUPERIOR to the camera in my G3. I've seen a lot of the ""jello"" wobbly video effect in my G3, which is completely absent from this camera. The colors are rich and vibrant. I carried a Fuji XE-2 camera with me in China, but did use the phone for lots of quick videos and photos. I'm really impressed with the HDR photos and the speed and accuracy and of focus.  Because of the water resistance, I didn't worry about the occasional rain I experienced, though I tend to throw everything electronic into my backpack when the rain falls.

I used the phone for messaging back home and domestic messaging and calls in China and it worked great.  The US style charging plug that came with the phone was compatible with the sockets in Chinese hotels...though I think that goes for most phones these days.

For surfing the web, the phone is quick and responsive. I can't speak to how it handles gaming, as I haven't yet installed any games.

The phone has no wasteful bloatware, so like a lot of folks say, it's yours to build as you like. I really can't see how you can go wrong with this phone.  Best wishes!","5.0 out of 5 stars"

The most impressive part is that this phone costs under $200, and depending on where you get it (like from a cellular carrier selling it unlocked) it can come in UNDER $170. So it's ""cheap"" and competes in a crowded arena with some equally great devices in the sub $200-$300 price point. I'll go over those later. The ""G"" comes in 2 versions: an 8 GB and 16 GB. This one is the 8 GB version. All are GSM quad band devices (you can use them all over the world, and will be 3G compatible) and finally support LTE! It's unlocked so you can use it on any GSM carrier, and it will work internationally (Europe, Asia, Mexico, South America, etc.). For connectivity there's WiFi a/b/g/n, Bluetooth 4.0, GPS with GLONASS and A-GPS, and an FM radio. There is no NFC on the G.

For those curious, the Moto G is Motorola's 2nd-tier smartphone, a step above the sub-$150 Moto E, and it's a pretty nice upgrade. What do you get for under $170 to $200? A lot. The device is definitely not what you'd call ""low-end."" It's got really generous hardware, a solid build, and a high-quality feel and finish. It's also ruggedized and IPX7 certified (30 minutes water resistance in 3 feet of water) so you can dunk it in the toilet and it will be fine, or drop it in the pool and have a working phone.

It's not a small device, but not as big as the 5.5"" phablets. This is a pretty ""normal"" sized phone. It's 5.5"" tall, 2.85"" wide by .46"" thick. It weighs a little over 6 ounces, so it's not lightweight but not heavy. The back is curved so it fits well in your hand and is comfortable to hold with one hand. The back cover is textured with a grainy soft plastic coating, which doesn't show fingerprints and is really easy to grip. The camera lens also doesn't stick out, so it lays flat on surfaces. It never fell out of my hand. The back is removable, but sadly, the battery isn't. You do get a micro-sim slot and a slot for a 32 GB maximum MicroSD card, which is nice considering a lot of phones are moving away from that.

For the hardware, it comes with a Qualcomm Snapdragon 410, which is a quad-core CPU running at 1.4 GHz, and an Adreno 306 graphics processor (upgraded from the 2nd Gen Moto G's 305), and 1 GB RAM. The 16 GB version has 2 GB, but cost about $40 more, and if you want the most out of the phone, it's a good investment. I'd have liked to see the Snapdragon 615 like on the Alcatel Idol 3, but Motorola had to cut costs somewhere. Plus, the screen doesn't need a lot of processing power and there aren't any 3rd party apps on here to use system resources, so the 410 is perfectly fine.

One of the areas Motorola cut costs is in the screen. Instead of a 5.5"" full HD screen with 400+ pixels per inch (PPI), you get a 5"" 720p HD IPS touch screen with 295 PPI covered in Gorilla Glass 3. It's very vivid, the colors are bright and accurate, and it's extremely responsive to touch. Text and graphic are sharp and you have to look real hard to make out individual pixels. Great for reading and viewing videos. The screen itself isn't edge-to-edge and has about a 3/8"" bezel top and bottom. There are no physical front panel buttons, and only two physical buttons on the right side of the device for power/lock, and volume. The buttons have an excellent feel and presses are very solid, and the power button has a textured finish.

There is a single speaker below the screen. The 2nd Gen Moto G had stereo speakers, but this one only has a single speaker (the Alcatel Idol 3 has two stereo speakers). For the record, the audio quality from the speaker is excellent. Loud, not very tinny like some at high volumes, and even a little ""bassy""  but not like the Alcatel Idol 3. The speakerphone is great. As good or better than the ones on $600 devices. There's also a dedicated active noise-cancelling microphone.

Motorola took the camera from the Nexus 6 and stuck it in the Moto G, so you get a 13 megapixel camera with a wide f/2.0 aperture. It comes lightly equipped with geotagging, face detection, auto HDR (high dynamic range), 4x digital zoom, autofocus, panorama mode, low-light mode, and adjustable brightness and exposure. There's a dual-tone flash that doubles as a video light. Not a lot of features or shooting modes, and no manual controls for the camera, but it's good as it is. There's a 5 megapixel front camera as well for selfies. The Moto G shoots full HD videos as well, but the front camera only does VGA resolution.

The operating system is what I love about the Moto G. Out of the box it needed a software update to run Android Lollipop 5.1.1, and it's ""vanilla"" Android, so there's no user interface and NO bloatware, which is awesome because half of all the preloaded apps that come on phones these days is useless to me and takes up storage and system resources. Not so with the G. You get all the basic Google apps like Google Now, Google+, YouTube, Facebook, Picasa, Amazon, and others. Just real basic. No carrier-installed rubbish. Google Now is Siri's little sister and works really well- ""OK Google...."" works great. There's rumors that Motorola will be patching the Moto G with Marshmallow 6.0 here soon.

The G comes with Android Lollipop. This was my first time using Lollipop and it was a really good experience. Motorola kept the App Drawer, and the pull-down menu has 2 stages, one for apps and notifications, and another for the pull-down menu. Very easy to use and the menus and features are well laid-out and easy to find. My parents never used or owned a smartphone before, and they are learning how to use the G really quickly! Everything you can imagine is customizable on the G. Like the Nexus phones, there's no manufacturer-installed user interface, so you get the clean version of Android, which is really easy to use. There's no ridiculous and unnecessary apps to navigate so the app drawer isn't very full and easy to negotiate for a first-time user.

So how does the G do? I think it was really great. The phone is fast and performance is snappy. Motorola did a good job matching it with the 410 processor. I never had an issue with lagging when switching between menus or apps, launching apps was fast, and having multiple apps running at the same time didn't slow it down. I ran Maps and it runs really well. There will be some cases where it will bog down, like when playing games or a video at the same time, or during intensive multitasking. That's due to the 1 GB RAM. The Snapdragon 410 was plenty powerful enough. Don't expect amazing performance or gameplay though. The Adreno 306 is only marginally better than the 305 in the old Moto G. Expect this phone to be as good as the others in this price bracket. Web browsing (I use Dolphin Browser) was really good with the LTE and large screen. Pages loaded quickly and scrolling was smooth and responsive. No issues there. The bummer is the 1 GB RAM. The phone works well with the 1 GB RAM, but to get the most out of it you need the 2 GB. Most all the other budget devices in this class have 2 GB. Data connectivity is the usual GSM, but the Moto G also has LTE (on bands 2, 4, 5, and 7, and 17), so it runs the fastest mobile data out there on just about every major carrier (ATT, Cricket, T-Mobile, Consumer Cellular, Metro PCS). Plus it's factory unlocked so all you need is a SIM card to run it on any GSM carrier. You can also use it as a mobile hot spot. Data speeds on Consumer Cellular were very good with the G. On LTE with good signal strength on the SpeedTest App, I averaged 20 Mbps download and 10 mbps upload. Not bad considering that it shares network capacity with ATT and T-Mobile.

The camera is very good. It's the same one from the Nexus 6, and that's a nice addition considering the price. Like the screen and other hardware, I expected the camera to be one of the areas Motorola had to downgrade to keep the the base Moto G under $200. Don't expect amazing picture quality from this camera, but you will be surprised, especially if coming from devices like the LG Optimus series devices or lower-end Galaxy phones. It has autofocus, but no image stabilization (optical or digital). Daytime pictures looked really nice with decent amounts of detail and the color reproduction was very good and there's little image processing so time between shots was very low- well under a second between from focus to finished picture. It's a tap-to-focus and there's no on-screen focus or shutter button, so that made it a little hard to get used to. The camera menu is accessed by swiping to the left across the screen and scrolling vertically through the menus. Surprisingly, nighttime shooting was disappointing without the flash, despite the f/2.0 lens. It's not terrible, and a lot better than other ""budget"" smartphone cameras and on par with the competitors (Asus Zenfone 2, Alcatel Idol 3), but image quality drops off considerably without the flash, which was nice and bright and didn't turn the pictures blue or overexpose them. The images with the flash came out warm and natural-looking. The useful range of the flash is capped at 3 meters in a pitch black room.

The Lithium ion (not polymer) battery seems small at 2470 mAh, but it lasts a long time in this phone. The screen is small and doesn't use a lot of power despite being LCD and not LED. The processor doesn't use a lot of power either, so you'd have no trouble getting a full day out of the G with battery to spare at the end of the day. I'd say you could go a full day and a half to two days without charging it under normal use. It doesn't have wireless charging or quick-charging capabilities, but you can't expect that from a sub-$200 handset. The only bummers with this phone is the lack of a removable battery, small screen, no NFC or quick charging, and it only has 1 GB RAM. The 8 GB storage is quickly used (half by the operating system and installed apps), so there's only about 4 GB left to work with, which isn't much these days. Thankfully, Lollipop lets you save apps to the SD card, but the Moto G is limited to a 32 GB max card. Most of the competitors have 64 GB. If you like to download videos and have lots of pictures and apps, then you will need the SD card. Thankfully, SD cards are cheap!

So...

Pros:

Incredible value for the money
Great performance
Rugged and water proof
LTE and quad-band GSM
Battery lasts a long time
Easy to handle
Comes with stock Lollipop Android 5.1.1
MicroSD slot
Very good camera
No bloatware!

Cons:

Only has 1 GB RAM for the 8 GB version
16 GB version is $40 more
SD card limited to 32 GB
No NFC
Screen could be bigger
Graphics processor could be better
Battery isn't removable
A little thick and heavy

I'm a little peculiar with electronics, but I really can't say anything bad about the Moto G 3rd Gen. For the money, it's a fantastic device and I can't see how Motorola got the price under $180 for the 8 GB version (some are under $170). The camera is very good, a huge upgrade over the previous Moto G's and better than some comparable phones in this class. I love the stock Android, it's rugged and water proof, has LTE, and the battery lasts a long time. It's easy to use, and has very good performance. If you think about it, the competition (Asus Zenfone 2, Alcatel Idol 3) are faster, have better screens, and somewhat better cameras, but cost more. If you don't mind the 1 GB RAM, 32 GB SD card limit and 5"" screen, then the Motorola Moto G is going to be the lone survivor in the budget phone arena. If you want a great phone for well under $200 (for the 8 GB version) that has some higher-end features and great functionality, then the Moto G is going to be the one I recommend. I am a phone connoisseur, and was impressed with the Moto G. Great phone and the standout in the class. You won't find a better deal in this price range.","5.0 out of 5 stars"

I ended up taking the phone back after tremendous amounts of researching and finding nothing that could solve my issue.

Pros:
- Great screen, speakers, buttons, hardware seems nice.
- Supposedly water resistant
- Snappy Android Marshmallow.  No real slow-downs or hiccups from the phone at all.

Cons:
- Battery:  So, it's supposed to have a big battery in it. However, for me it literally took 4-5 hours to charge from 0 (which happened a couple of times, unfortunately).  This charging time is unacceptable for a phone that one uses daily and needs a charge in the morning before going to work.
  Also, if I forget to charge it at night, it will go to 0% and shut down overnight.  All I know is that ""Android System"" seemed to be the number one culprit on the report.  In typical Android fashion, I hit every setting I could in order to preserve the battery.  I completely turned off data as well.  It could be anything at this point, and got sick of constantly baby-sitting it, so it's going back.
- Occasionally, for some reason, the micro sd card dismounts, with no notification whatsoever.  You have to find out by realizing something that uses the SD Card (like books or music) is missing from the phone.  Even rebooting doesn't mount it.  So, because it's water resistant, you have to take off the back to take out the card, and put it in.  This is very annoying for a new phone and the latest OS.

I really wanted to like this phone.  But something about it (the hardware, OS, etc.) just makes it unreliable to me.  A real let-down.

UPDATE:  Do NOT buy anything from Motorola!  They're customer service is all outsourced, and they all tell you different things.  Still waiting for my refund on this junky phone.  Apple messes up as well, but at least the 3rd time they get the job done.  Spend a little more $$ and buy the iPhone SE.  You'll save yourself a ton of headache.","1.0 out of 5 stars"

I use my phone daily and it still holds a good charge throughout the day and runs my apps and games flawlessly.
Maybe a phone case would help prevent the peeling/movement of the battery cover.

Pros:
Holds a good charge even after 3 months.
Runs apps and games smooth.
Camera is pretty decent.

Cons:
Battery cover didn't fit properly and creaks a bit when holding and pushing the side buttons.
Battery covers gloss is starting to peel after 3 months of normal use.

The metal prongs are pretty weak, and stick out a bit, so it's possible to get your SIM card stuck, or to dislodge a metal prong, which makes all SIM cards stop reading.

I've had it for 3 months at the time of this review. The first thing I'll say is that the device has been underwhelming since the minute I opened the box. I realize this is a budget phone, but it was a real let down compared to my Nexus 4, which I purchased years ago for $300 (not a whole lot more).

But I can live with something that is just okay--it's just a phone, right? So I gave it a shot.

Today I contacted Motorola support. I updated the phone to Android 6.0 Marshmallow awhile back, and since then I have had a few days when the device just rebooted without any input from me. After asking me to select some options in Settings which were not available to me, the support person suggested that I need to do a factory reset to resolve the problem. Yes, that kind of factory reset, the kind where you have to back up your data and set up your device anew.

I convinced support to try something else. We are now wiping the cache partition. Hopefully that helps.

At the end of the day, I can't condone this. Deleting a user's personal data and resetting the phone should not be the first thing a support person has to try to get a device working again after an update. I'd go on about the other underwhelming features and petty annoyances of the Moto G, or the fractured and unreliable update ecosystem that is Android, but I'll save you the pain.

I regret not getting a Nexus 5X. Go spend a few dollars more and try that instead.","2.0 out of 5 stars"

UPDATE 2: Upgrading back to 3 stars. I sent my phone to Motorola Care and they sent me a new replacement 8 or 9 business days later. So they did the right thing. I like the phone so hopefully I won't have any more problems.

UPDATE 1: Downgrading this review to 1 star. This phone is giving me a constant error message that reads: SD Card Was Unexpectedly Removed. And all the photos and apps on the SD card are not accessible until the phone is restarted. Works fine for a while, then it happens again and again. Brand-new SD card, a SanDisk 32GB Class 10. I've owned a lot of Android smartphones and I've never seen anything like this. Same thing happens when other SD cards are tried. Works for a while, then the card crashes. If you Google this, you will see it is apparently a common problem with Motorola phones.

ADVICE: If you buy this phone, DO NOT buy it directly from the Motorola website like I did. Motorola does not make it easy to get a replacement phone. They will try to charge you. Buy it from Amazon where returns are simple and easy.

Original review: This is probably the best ""cheap"" smartphone you can buy.
I bought three of these for my family and took them to Cricket Wireless for a very good unlimited data, multiple-phone deal.
I have no complaints about the phone except that I've only had it for a week and It needs to go back to Motorola for repairs.
The edges of the screen and the earpiece/speaker are wide and very deep set. These areas collect lots of dust very easily.
I tried to use a very soft toothbrush to GENTLY clear the dust from the earpiece and it immediate punctured the thin waterproof membrane that covers the earpiece. The waterproof membrane covering the earpiece is thinner than paper. It's like rice paper.
So the phone still works, but the waterproofing has been compromised. And it happened very, very easily.
So it will be $70 to ship it back and have it repaired. No fun.
Motorola gives ZERO instructions regarding how to keep the phone clean, but my advice is DO NOT try to brush the dust off.
Ever.
The waterproof membrane is super-delicate and really should be covered by a grille of some kind. It's a design flaw in my opinion.
Other than that, I'm happy with the phones so far. Best deal in mobile!","4.0 out of 5 stars"

The build quality on the phone seems very good and the phone feels solid and durable.  I like the feel of the textured rubber back.  The setup was a breeze - I just inserted my sim card, logged in to my gmail account and created a MotoID.  In terms of performance, the phone feels very similar to my Nexus 5, if not slightly snappier.  It plays Asphalt 8 just fine.  The OS is _very_ close to stock Android like my Nexus was, and I really like the few deviations it has, such as the motion gestures that are actually useful and convenient (you can simply ""twist"" the phone to launch the camera app or shake it turn the flashlight on or off - even when the phone is off).  The camera takes crisp, sharp pictures, even in some fairly challenging light conditions.  It did struggle a bit with taking pictures of Christmas lights but, admittedly, I was in a hurry and didn't take much care in focusing the camera on the lights or adjusting any of the settings.

Pros:
- ""Cheap""
- Solid performance
- Good camera
- Useful enhancements over stock Android
- Waterproof
- Built solid enough that I'm comfortable not using a case with it
- SD Card slot
- Good battery life (1.5-2 days with moderate to heavy use)

Cons:
- A bit bulkier than my Nexus 5, but that is mostly offset by not needing a case.
- Haven't received the Android 6 update yet.","5.0 out of 5 stars"

The software is fantastic, one of the smoothest running android phones I've used, and at such a great price.

Although it is a good size for a phone with a 5-inch screen, the thickness makes it unusable in one hand, at least for me.

I was able to deposit my check via my bank's app with no problem at all, something my previous phone(Blu Advance 4) couldn't do.

One problem I did encounter was being forced to update the software and then encounter infinite reboot loop afterwards. I don't know if this is an Android OS issue or Motorola's software, but it was definitely not that I wanted to experience when using a new phone.

Overall so far it has fulfilled all of my needs and surprised me with its performance. I would recommend this phone over others that are around the same price range.","4.0 out of 5 stars"

Despite being a couple years old, the G2 packed some really premium features into its case, so I was looking for a phone that wouldn't feel like a step back, while still keeping roughly the same form factor (today's top-of-the-line phones are all BIG).

I did a mountain of research and feature comparisons between all the Android phones on the market. I was looking for something that wasn't too expensive (sub-$400), wasn't too big (sub-5.2-inch screen), had an SD card slot for expandable memory, a decent amount of RAM, and a camera that performed okay in low light, but I wanted to believe I could sacrifice a little of all that stuff for a low-cost phone that could handle my usual day-to-day tasks.

For everyday use, I need a web browser, Google Now, Spotify, YouTube, the Facebook home screen widget, and, during the baseball season, the MLB.com app and widget. I have a couple of young kids at home, so I want a camera that can adequately capture the cute things they do, especially under indoor lighting conditions. I look at my screen between 2 and 3 hours in a 14-hour day. I don't have much use for NFC or a fingerprint scanner.

The first stop in my phone-buying journey was purchasing this phone from a store near my house. I wanted to see if all the glowing reviews were true, and if I could live with a $179 phone after using flagships my whole smartphone-owning life. Long story short: I couldn't. The Moto G 3rd gen met my needs better than I expected it to, but not quite as well as I needed.

Good stuff abut this phone:

1. The software on the Moto G is very nearly stock Android, which suited me fine, even coming from the heavily-modified version I was using on the LG G2. The phone performed relatively quickly, and all my apps and widgets loaded fine. Set up was supremely easy, and the Moto Migrate software was a godsend. My contacts, apps, call logs, pictures, and SMS messages were sent over from the G2 in mere moments. I think I had the phone customized to my needs (including logging into all my apps) within 10 minutes, and it felt like I could walk out the door and not think about it again.

2. The Moto gestures (double twist for camera and double chop for flashlight) are AMAZING, though I'd prefer it if the flashlight stayed on after I set the phone down. I like to sometimes use my phone as a lantern in the bedroom when I'm getting in bed, instead of turning on a light.

3. The camera is tremendous... if you're outside with good natural light. Indoors under incandescents or fluorescents it's really poor. It launches quickly and does a good job with focus.

4. The size of the phone was perfect. Its dimensions are nearly identical to the LG G2, so it felt great in my hand and my pocket, and I pretty quickly adapted to the location of the buttons. It also uses a micro-SIM card, which meant I didn't have to go into a carrier store to get a new SIM just to use my phone.

Bad stuff about this phone:

1. My day-to-day use was apparently too much for the Moto G to handle. I'd have frequent app crashes, and widgets would fail to update—or even fail to load entirely. I think the 1 gig of RAM was too little for my needs, but I can't be sure that's all it was. There is also a noticeable lag to using this phone that I wasn't ready for. I never tried a 2 gig version, because I was loathe to order from Motorola directly, wait for the phone to arrive, and then ship it back to them if it didn't turn out well.

2. The camera indoors worked so poorly for my needs. It was slow to focus, and it produced images that were marred with tons of blur, coming out as yellow-tinted, blocky messes, even with all the lights in the house on. And the camera app is so dumbed down that it's less useful than it should be. Put a dang shutter button on the screen, Moto!

3. The battery charges sooooooo sloooowwwwwly. It took 4 hours to charge it, and it barely lasted the entire day on a charge. What gives?

My final verdict:

I couldn't make this phone usable for my needs. If you or someone you love needs an uncomplicated phone that can make calls, get them on the internet, handle Facebook and email fine, and take good pictures of flowers and trees and outside things, tell them to buy a Moto G. It would be a great phone for my mother in-law, but it didn't quite cut it for me.

As for my smartphone journey: I love Moto's customizations enough that I sacrificed my size requirement and ended up choosing a Moto X Pure, even after a two-week period where I compared it directly to the smaller LG Nexus 5X. For my money, the Moto X Pure is the best phone out right now—even with its similar indoor-camera issues—but I'm a little biased, because I had a 10% off coupon from BBY and got mine for $45 off the retail price.","3.0 out of 5 stars"

I had the Nexus 5 previously and now I have gone for the cheaper, non-flagship option, and I MUCH prefer it! It works faster, there are less pre-loaded apps, and it is slightly smaller and lighter. Also, it was a WAY better camera!

**EDIT (January 13, 2016): I've had this phone for about 2 months, and  I recently updated the phone to the new Android OS (Marshmallow 6.0) and the OS takes up half of the 8gb available, and then other built-in apps take up even more storage, and the phone is now hardly functional. I bought an SD card to expand storage but now with the update you have to choose between portable and external storage and if you choose ""internal"" you can no longer use the SD card in any other device, and you can no longer access the internal storage, so I don't want to make my SD card less useful, and if I don't format it for internal storage I can't move apps over to it. It seems like 8gb is just too low of memory for this phone. So I just ordered the bigger option (16gb & 2gb RAM) and am going to return this smaller one. I love the phone over all, but the internal memory is just too low to keep up with the constant Android OS and app updates that keep taking up more memory every time. I was trying to get a ""future-proof"" phone and for that it seems like 16gb internal memory is the minimum necessary for that. The 1gb of RAM in this version has been fine for me, I don't play games but tend to multitask using apps and several internet windows at once and I didn't notice any lag or problems until this new update took up way more of the internal storage available. I wish that Motorola offered the base product Moto G 3rd Gen with 16gb internal storage, it seems a bit tricky to put out a product that is cheaper but won't keep up with Android updates! Definitely shell-out the extra $40 if you are interested in getting a phone that will last!","5.0 out of 5 stars"

The Samsung had a few features which this one doesn't. I don't know if they are Android features or Samsung ones. I can't run a split screen on this phone I don't think like I could on the Samsung. I didn't do it very often but it was a nice feature when I wanted to have Google Maps navigation and my radar detector app both on the screen at the same time. My Samsung charging port finally got to the point where it needed to be replaced because it wasn't charging correctly.

Compared to my old S3 this phone seems to be much smoother and faster. Even though it is a lower end phone it still is better than a high end phone from 3 years ago performance wise. The MotoG seems to have extraordinary battery life compared to my old S3. Maybe it is the new Android OS but I am a light user and only charge the phone once every 3 or 4 days. I used to have to charge my S3 daily.

I decided not to buy a Samsung again because I didn't like that I had to root the phone and do all sorts of stupid tricks to use the device as a wifi hotspot because it was an unlocked AT&T phone instead of a direct purchase and had all sorts of AT&T software on it that couldn't be removed and kept me from running the hotspot. Maybe the new ones don't have this junk on them.

The couple of things I wish were different about this phone.
1. No removable battery.
2. USB charging port will eventually have the same issue that the S3 had from continual plugging/unplugging. I wish it has a prong type charger connection as an option or additional feature.

Bottom line: for the 220 I paid for this thing it is serving me much better than the 600+ I paid for a lesser S3. Just like computers, phones get better and cheaper every year. This MotoG is more than good enough for everything I do.  Probably in a couple of years I will get another 200$ phone that is better than the 700$ they are selling today.","4.0 out of 5 stars"

For the price, this phone's offerings are worth five stars. The 16 GB storage, 2 MB RAM version is almost as robust as similar phones on the market that cost $600+. My phone arrived with Android 6.0 Marshmallow installed. Functions and apps work smoothly; I did not detect a slower performance on this phone than my newly retired Samsung Galaxy S4. Camera takes good photos except in low light, but that's no different than the S4. The battery power is sufficient, though you simply cannot get a lot of battery power unless you are using a much larger phone (phablet) with a much larger battery. Leaving the phone idle for several hours does not drain the battery.

The two major difference I've noticed between this Moto G vs. other higher end phones are the display resolution is not as robust and the speaker sound is low quality. The phone outer body is built well and the ""water resistant"" feature is great if you drop your phone in water for a few seconds, but prevents you from being able to change out the battery. The SIM and SD card slots, however, are easy to access if you pull off the back cover. Having a SD card slow is a major plus for this phone, and one that many  manufacturers are moving away from so that they can charge you more money for cheap pre-installed memory.  The sound quality is not an issue for me as I connect my phone to Bluetooth devices when listening to music.

The front facing speaker on this one, similar to the HTC One, is an EXCELLENT design feature. Who listens to their phone from the back of the phone??? As far as I know, people look at their phones from the front and hold their phones with the front facing their ear while talking on the phone.

The button placements on the Moto G are also well thought out, as the volume up/down buttons and power button are both on the top right side edge of the phone. I didn't know this at the time, but Samsung placed opposable buttons on their S4 and I accidentally  hung up on people about 50% of the time because my index finger just happened to rest on that stupidly placed button while I was holding the phone.

I'm also really enthused about the lack of bloatware installed on this unlocked version as when I was a Verizon customer who installed such apps such as NFL on my phone that I could not uninstall, and which took up a lot of space on my phone's memory card. Unlocked is the way to go to avoid the bloatware from Verizon and AT&T.

Also I appload Moto for continuing to produce a phone that isn't a huge phablet; some customers like myself do not ever want a phablet sized phone, and my options in the market currently were very limited. Please continue to think of us consumers who have hands that are not as large as an NFL player's.

This phone has worked splendidly with Cricket Wireless's service. An unlocked phone will give you more options for service providers.

This phone is far ahead of the Galaxy S4 I just retired (except for display quality), and at a third of the price.","5.0 out of 5 stars"

When I got the 2nd gen one, i wasnt impressed with it. This 3rd gen has a lot to go for. One may think it is a $600+ phone. One giveaway would be the screen resolution - it's 720p, which is ""low"" these days compared to all the hd stuff out there. I may even start thinking about it's low memory and storage, but then immediately think about it's price.

Coming from Samsung, it's a bit weird not to have a physical home button. On this phone, they are icons on the screen. No big deal. That's more screen size.

Anyway, I can praise this all day long.

Pros: Good looks, micro SD slot (!!!), water protection, latest OS, and of course, the price
Cons: I honestly cant bring myself to complain about the storage and memory. 32GB microsd card cost me 12 bucks, and that should be enough for all the photos and videos I take.

Just note that this version will not work with Verizon here in the United States.

What makes it excellent? It's the fact that it feels snappy and responsive, has decent battery life, and a better than expected camera. It will very easily meet the needs of most casual smartphone users for a price substantially less than that of some of the flagship phones on the market.

It's also waterproof up to 3 feet at 30 minutes. So it can be dropped in a sink or bathtub without any damage to the phone provided the backing is secured to the properly. I demonstrate the waterproofing in the video.

Motorola is taking a unique approach to the Android phone market by delivering good hardware at a low price without a carrier obligation. This phone most certainly is that - a sub $200 that will be more than adequate for most people in the market for a decent phone.

I first wrote this review because I was very upset that the new changes updated to my phone (which said Marshmallow and S'more at the time it was updating) left me without the ability to use my voice activated dialing and answering features on my hands free speaker for phones in my car.  Since I use that feature 90% of the time that I use my phone, to me it is a BIG deal.  That, of course, is due to the software update, not the phone itself at this point.

The review about that is following this- my newest impressions of this phone.  I am expounding upon what I have experienced SINCE writing the review I started with and will eventually update to a more detailed and orderly review as I get to experience more and more of the phone over time.
----------
Because I am not a smart phone expert, I am not sure which of the following features are due to the ""marshmallow/s'more"" updates that were applied to the phone, or just the phone itself.

WHAT I LIKE ABOUT THIS PHONE
BLAZING fast speed when using data
Limits you can apply for data use when using the phone
Great response of the screen, even with a tempered glass cover on it
Quick response when dialing and using phone
LOUD speaker phone
Can hear very well when talking without speaker phone
People can hear me loudly when I use this phone
Screen clarity and saturation excellent
Microphone transcription of text messages works great
Wi Fi works great in any store or at home
Do Not Disturb feature

WHAT I DON'T LIKE ABOUT THIS PHONE
Inability to use voice activated dialing and answering with handsfree device
Hard to get used to after using the Rugby flip phone
Hanging up from a phone call can be challenging at times
Putting on speaker phone is too involved to be used fast
Should come with a printed manual

PHONE SERVICE I AM USING WITH THIS PHONE
Consumer Cellular

Again, I will update with a very orderly and coherent review of this phone the more that I get to use it.  I just want to keep people updated for until I get a more orderly review to post with more details.

WE HAVE TWO PHONES- HOW MY HUSBAND'S EXPERIENCE IS SO FAR
Both my husband and I have these phones and he is one of the worst people on phones I have ever met.  He is AWFUL.  He is technically challenged and so rough physically I was worried as to how long this would last.  So far, it has lasted a month for him.  He loves it.  It is easy for him to use which shocks me truly.  The man has already dropped it many times and has broken the case that he bought for it, but the phone is still doing great.

More on that when I get a chance to update again and put some better order to this review.

----------------------------------------------
(FORMER REVIEW ORIGINALLY POSTED)
I don't normally write a poor review but right now, I think it is necessary.

I purchased the Moto G 3rd gen phone not too long ago after reading tons of reviews and write ups and all sorts of raves about this phone.  There is one thing that I would have liked to know which is ESSENTIAL to me and if I had known this, I would not have purchased this phone.

Yes, this phone has nice screen, nice features, and works okay.  For the price it is decent, EXCEPT THERE IS NO HANDS FREE VOICE RECOGNITION FOR DRIVING BUILT INTO THIS PHONE.

I have had phones which are ARCHAIC compared to this phone that have had voice recognition.  That allows the phone to answer through a bluetooth device such as a speaker in the car.

I recently just discovered that the Moto Assist has been retired from the Marshmallow update so there are not any options for this phone to be used hands free while driving, so even the option that ate up data time is now gone.

That makes me very upset.

I could rave on about the other features of this phone, and perhaps to some of you that would be enough.  However, in my situation, when I am driving, I like to be able to talk via bluetooth speaker phone in the car and not rake up huge data bills.

Any other app that we have tried does not work right with this phone, either.

I will update this review should I find an acceptable solution to this problem and if I decide to keep the phone.  For now, I could care less about all of the fancy features of the phone when I can not use it for one of the essential tasks that I use constantly when driving.

UPDATE
I am waiting for something to change in Marshmallow, but I will take some time and update this review with my detailed observations of this phone as I continue to use it while NOT in the car driving.  Other than the problem which is an Android problem, not Motorola (although their program that used to work no longer does for that purpose) I have found the phone to be a very decent  budget phone compared to others I have used.

I will update soon as I can to reflect my other opinions on the phone.  I did want to warn people right away about the current situation in case they were depending on this phone to use for hands free driving to call and answer via bluetooth speakers.  If you have an older phone that will not update to Marshmallow, then you will probably be okay.  I would wait for an upgrade if your current phone works fine with your bluetooth speakers in the car at least to use it for your phone at this point.","5.0 out of 5 stars"

Althougt I only go the 8 GB model I was able to install a further 32 GB of memory which saved me from the memory shortage issue.

I am less enamoured of the radio antenna performance.  It does not show I am getting a 4G signal in those places where my other phone quite easily gets a 4 G signal.  I am note sure if this is a problem with the antenna indicator or what but the time being I have done nothing about it  .

It takes a bit of time getting used to the new operating system and a lot of tweaking that has to be done after migrating my settings.  The biggest headache was the messaging notification Led light.  I had to download Flash Alerts 2 app by MegaWave Software and purchase it for a couple bucks to enable Application Filter (part of Status Bar Change within that program).  In setting the Application Filter, I checkmark messaging, phone, etc... that are important to a ring, vibrate, silent, etc...  If that program wasn't available, then the user would have to go through the hard way that could take more than 3 hours to figure it out and would void the warranty of the phone.  It's found in this article:  http://www.droidguiding.com/how-to-enable-hidden-led-notification-on-3rd-gen-moto-g-2015 (my phone wouldn't be recognized on Windows 10 but on a Windows 7 computer for ""rooting"" the phone.  I successfully rooted my Moto X phone with Windows 7 through Motorola website (will need your Motorola userID and pwd).  It's not an easy thing to do and I would leave that to the developers; in fact, you would also need to enable that phone as a developer phone, search online for that!

The camera is definitely a big improvement, I don't expect it to be great in low light settings but it's definitely a step up.  The screen is slightly bigger and helps on my eyes.  This thing fits in my pocket like a pocket knife.  It would be five stars if they had included led notification light in the settings of Google Lollipop 5.1.1.  The Internet speed is much faster on Verizon FIOS wireless.  Make sure you buy storage like 32GB MicroSD before using the phone.  The storage it has is like 4.5 Gb and I already used up 1/2 of it with all my apps installed.  When going into settings\storage\Apps (click on the Apps on that list, after Available).  Concentrate on the top 10, and open them all, Select ""Move to SD Card"" to move the data to the SD Card from the phone to save space.  People may not realize that this is how to save space on the primary phone.  If you have a ton of Apps on your current phone, I would NOT RECOMMEND this phone, just purchase one that is double the space, 16GB on the phone that is NOT SOLD on Amazon and has double the RAM (not sure it makes a difference for me since I had double the RAM on Moto X).

Hope all this helps!!!

May The Force Be With You.

UPDATE:  So far so good, I BIG problem is the party pictures in a room that is dimmed a bit.  MAKE SURE YOU  ENABLE NIGHT MODE.  It's no fun to see spooky ""white"" eyes.

After over 3 years on the previous phone...a smaller Samsung...I finally pulled the trigger on a new phone. And I couldn't be more pleased. I researched this purchase for a while and the Moto G 3 kept showing up as the best value in the under $300 category..consistently over the last few months. I looked at the main competitors..the Sony Experia and the Asus Zen Phone, and really wasn't that impressed. It seemed that this one was the better choice for the average phone user. A power user might disagree, but that's not me.This is a great phone that has snappy performance and just plays well. It's not loaded with too much crap either. Yes, the camera is decent, but I do my photography with a real camera and it wasn't a deciding factor. Call quality is definitely better than my previous phone and has better tone through the speaker. Some would point out that they cut corners with the 720p screen. I would say here that, if they had to cut corners to offer some other feature, they did it in a good place. For the most part, you really don't notice that the screen res is not up to snuff with the big money phones. Get over it with the specs already! They're often used as a marketing tool. People have a thing about this stuff. They have to out-spec the neighbors and the marketing and sales guys love this. Here the 720p screen is fine. Nuff said. If you need a medium priced phone, this one that easily deserves looking at. And yes, the 2g/16g combo is worth the extra bucks.","5.0 out of 5 stars"

Still have the 2015 moto E which has the same cpu as the moto G (except 200 mhz slower) with 1GB ram instead of 2GB.  dropped my moto X and it shattered into pieces and got the 2015 moto G with 2GB ram.

now based on using the moto E i expected it to be relatively smooth but i wasn't sure if the 2GB of ram would be hugely better or just a little.  the moto E was a little slow sometimes starting / switching apps.  let me tell you ,  the 2GB of ram is absolutely worth the $40 extra (not to mention the 8GB more flash).  the phone feels nearly as smooth as the 2015 moto X for most typical apps (like chrome, facebook , instagram etc) and feels like a hugely better phone than the moto E (and the E isn't that bad).  its definitely around as fast as the 2013 moto X which was a flagship with probably 3 times the battery life and a much better camera.  the camera really isn't that much worse than the 2015 moto x .  i'd say this was the phone i should have bought in the first place as i normally don't like investing in flagship phones.  the X has much nicer speakers,  a nicer screen (though really it wasnt that big a deal for me) but its bigger and has probably 70% the battery life and costs twice as much and was a bit harder to hold (which is how i accidentally dropped it on to a concrete floor :( ).

anyway,  i'd just like to say this is probably one of the best bargains in android phone land out there.  i'm an android developer for my job, and have an S6 edge and nexus 5 and a few other test phones, and i still choose to buy THIS phone.  thats how great a value it is.  its everything you need and nothing you dont.  spend the money on other things!","5.0 out of 5 stars"

Here are my opinions of the phone so far.

Pros:
Price
Clear sounding phone calls
No bloatware
Good sounding front speaker (for a phone)
Decent camera (not so much in low light)
Good LTE signal indoors (T-Mobile)
Good battery life

Cons:
GPU is dated, not meant for serious gaming
8gb model is not enough storage, 16gb model is barley acceptable
stock notification sounds and ringtones are just awful

For a budget phone this device meets all my expectations. There are other devices that are just as good at the same price and the Moto G does nothing to really stand out, so I guess it up to personal preference. I chose this phone because there wasn't any bloatware, has a good camera, and its only $200 unlocked.","4.0 out of 5 stars"

First, I needed an unlocked phone that would allow me to switch and/or install two SIM cards and work on European LTE networks because that's where I spend months at a time. Next, since neither my professional or personal identity depends on what cell phone I use, I was not willing to spend oodles of mone, but at the same time wanted functionality, quality, and reliability.  Moto G 3rd Gen has met my objectives and then some. I've had the phone for about two months now. I am not a heavy user and don't live my life attached to social networks.  I make and receive maybe twenty calls a day; send and receive about the same number of texts;  check, write and send any number of e-mails; use a few aps - banking, weather, calendar & notifications, memos & schedules, etc; google a few things; check Twitter; take and send a couple of photos a day; and that about does it.  Battery life is excellent and with an overnight charge, I've had no worries.  Speaker sound is also really crips.  Photos are as good as from any other phone. The phone looks and feels very solid and smooth, and while it's not an S6, for under $180 that I spent on the white model, I have no complaints.  Actually I do.  So far there has been no accessories for this newer 3rd Gen release.  It's like what Motorola offers is pretty much what you get.

I don't have any music,or video in memory or any games or social media apps but 8 gb is not enough.  In the not too distant past this would not have been a problem because one could install apps on the  SD card, but newer Android versions restrict that.  If doing this again I would go for more memory.

Does everything I expect for a lot less than a Samsung Galaxy.  I also appreciate that it  isn't loaded with bloatware.  Great battery life.  My only complaint is that the volume and power switches are on the same side, next to each other.

I don't use tons of high performance apps, use this mostly for internet, calling and messaging. I can get two days out of the battery, which is awesome.

On my recommendation, my sister in high school who uses a ton of social media bought this same phone but found that the camera and performance weren't up to her standards. But if you truly are just looking for the basics, I would recommend this.

UPDATE: After about 5 months of use, this started getting worse. I've had to factory restart this phone 3 times and it keeps getting problems - won't read sim card, won't transfer apps to card, won't take pictures because it says I'm out of space, even after I delete pictures and apps, etc. Now, I would change my rating to two stars and ONLY recommend this phone if you are able and willing to do lots of trouble shooting (or have someone who will do it for you).","3.0 out of 5 stars"

This phone has fantastic battery life--on par or better than my Sony Xperia Z3C, which itself had a relatively enormous battery. With light use, I can get a full 2 days out of the phone, which is very important to me.

I also wanted a phone with the least amount of Android modification. I hate the bloatware and restyling of the Samsung phones, for example. For that reason I was strongly leaning toward a Nexus device. In the end I settled on this phone, as it had a smaller form factor than the Nexus devices, better battery life, and much better value. It also runs the latest Android 6.0, like the Nexus devices, and has minimal manufacturer bloatware. In fact, the few Motorola features that I notice are well integrated and actually improve the product: twisting the phone twice to activate the camera, and ""chopping"" the phone to turn on the light. I love these features and use them regularly.

I bought this phone because my last phone broke, which was recently. Thus I bought the phone over 6 months after its release, and kind of figured it would be a cheaper phone to hold me over until the next flagship devices come out this fall. But after my experience over the past month or so with the phone, I like it so much that I'm not sure I care about getting a higher end phone this year. I love it!","5.0 out of 5 stars"

I did not want to spend approx. $700 on a bloatware Samsung again. I purchased a Like New, damaged package unit for $187.00. The phone arrived brand new in new packaging on a Sunday, two day shipping free from Amazon.

Since this is almost stock Android, Motorola has already sent thru the Marshmallow update. I have been using Marshmallow for about a month already and love it. I would highly recommend the 2GB RAM version since the newer operating systems use more base memory, but are more efficient. I have very few apps installed and am diligent on checking memory usage of apps. I have 0.96GB free with very few small apps running in the background.

I love this phone and will probably get one for my wife.","5.0 out of 5 stars"

I really like this phone. The screen is amazingly responsive and I like the ability to sync with all of my google applications. The navigation was stellar while on the overseas trip and the camera is top notch. Really glad I upgraded before traveling.

My only complaint is that its a bit large, too large to fit in the average woman's pants pocket, but that seems to be the norm nowadays.

I also haven't had any issues with the phone itself getting really hot, like other buys have. I don't have mine in a case though, and once it did get warm, but that was after an hour of active navigation.

This is bc even in Android Marshmallow, external SD cards considered ""adoptable storage"" or ""internal storage"" do not actually function this way. There is still a difference between internal storage and SD card storage, and app developers can stipulate that their app must be on internal storage.

Unless you need a phone with 2 GB of RAM, or the 16 GB of storage (both phones can accept an SD card)  there is little reason to move up to the Motorola G 3rd Gen -  The electronics are updated, but unless you are comparing the two different phones side by side, you won't notice a difference.

The  Motorola G 3rd Gen, except for the electronics, is a lesser phone than the Motorola G 2nd Gen.  You don't have the option for a 2nd Sim, you don't get the stereo speakers, you don't get the notification light and you don't get the Sim Card carriage.

It seemed to tick all of the right boxes - 1) micro SD, 2) decent CPU / RAM, 3) great battery life and 4) a decent camera.

There was some issues with the phone, but in general, I had no complaint - it's a phone that is more than the sum of its parts.  Build quality, thoughtfulness and lack of bloatware add up to the best phone in its price range.

Now, the bad news . . . less than a month after I bought the phone, I started receiving more and more frequent ""Micro SD Card Unexpectedly Unmounted"" error messages.  I tried multiple micro SD cards, but all of them would soon fail within minutes.

I went to Motorola's website and sent in my unit for ""repair"".  It turns out that Motorola does NOT repair Moto Gs.  It holds them until it has a sufficient supply of refurbished phones in stock, which may take MONTHS.

Each time I called customer support, I was constantly told that my phone would be returned ""in a few days"".  It turns out that the lower tiers of customer service have no decision making authority - after a MONTH, I was placed into ""escalated customer service"".  The representative explained that they did not have any Moto Gs ""in stock for replacement service"" and they do not repair Moto Gs.  They had no clarity on when they would have phones in stock and I only had two options - wait for an unknown amount of time, accept a worse phone or return my broken phone.

As a result, I would sincerely caution any prospective buyer - it's a great phone, but the warranty is in name only.  Be careful that you do not send this phone in for repair - better to go to a third party and pay out of pocket.  Online searches after the fact revealed this is unfortunately not an isolated issue - Motorola has really cut down on their customer service for Moto Gs.

Performance is about the same between the two. So is battery life. I always install CyanogenMod on my phones, but the stock software is OK. An upgrade for this phone is obviously the camera, definetly better than my last one, but it show a lot of noise on indoor shots.

Here's why I went back to my 1st Gen.
This phone is too bulky, heavy, and big for what it is. I cannot figure out why a plastic 5"" budget phone with low end specs, and minimal features is this heavy. Another thing I missed is the LED notification.

Motorola's way of making sales is the ""one step forward, two step back"" approach. I.E the very first moto g only had 3g and no SD slot, then a revised version came out with 4g and a SD slot. Same thing with the second generation with 3g/4g. Now Motorola removed the notification LED, and I'm willing to bet it will be added to the 'new' Moto 3rd gen.

I won't say its a horrible phone. But its a very mediocre 'OK' phone. Nothing groundbreaking like the first gen, with even less features and a bigger heavier design.","3.0 out of 5 stars"

I learned the hard way when I plugged my phone into a newly bought charger (my wife bought it in an effort to get rid of the rat's nest of wires on the charging desk --- needless to say it's the most expensive charger she's ever bought --- lesson: keep your rats nest and stick with well-reviewed chargers). Well, my Xperia Z1's motherboard got fried, and I had to shop for a new phone in a hurry.

I liked the Xperia Z1, so my initial thought was to just simply purchase an Xperia Z3. Alas, the price I got from Amazon did turn out to be too good to be true. Upon receiving the phone, I checked it against Sony's website and discovered that the ""new"" phone I was sold only had 2 months of warranty left. In other words, some reseller had bought the phone from Sony or T-mobile, and was reselling it to me as ""new."" The full price of the phone ($550) was more than I could stomach, so I went looking for other choices.

My criteria were:
Waterproof: having learned from the Xperia Z1 how useful a feature that was, I wasn't willing to give this up.
MicroSD card storage. Sorry, I'm not paying $100 to get an extra 16GB of storage. That's for Apple users. (I paid $25 for a 64GB MicroSD card)
2GB of RAM, preferably 3.
5"" screen. More than that, and it's too awkward to hold one-handed.
Camera shutter button preferred.
Cheap. Let's face it, phone processor performance hasn't improved in years
Not surprisingly, other than the Xperia Z series, there are only a few phones that offer the first feature:
Sony M4 Aqua ($250)
Motorola Moto G ($220)
Samsung Galaxy S5 ($400)
The Samsung was too much to pay for, and I never liked the UI, so it came down to the Sony Aqua and the Moto G. I honestly did not expect the Moto G to be a contender, but since Lenovo acquired them from Google, Motorola has finally put microSD card storage even into its high end phones like the Moto X. Back when Google owned Motorola, it suffered from severe Apple envy and thought it could charge Apple-type prices for storage. The addition of waterproofing was a nice surprise. In fact, the higher-end phones in Motorola's line up all only have water-resistance, rather than being IP7 waterproof. I would have considered the shatter-proof Droid Turbo 2 if it had included water-proofing along with the 4 year anti-crack warranty. As it was, I figured I could get 3 Moto Gs for the price of one of those, and waterproofing trumps crack-proofing.

My experience with the Sony Z1 was that I was constantly getting applications killed. I'd play music and turn on navigation and music would die. I've also had the reverse happen. That made me wary of getting another Sony phone with just 2GB of RAM. (For whatever reason, this doesn't happen to my wife's Xperia Ultra Z, which at 6.5"" in size is so big that it also has wonderful voice and data reception!)

Reviews consistently state that the Moto G has a better camera (surprising, since the Moto G's camera is a Sony sensor). The Sony M4 Aqua also has a faster processor, NFC, supports up to 128GB of microSD storage and is thinner. Both phones are 720p 5"" displays, which is fine. What's interesting is that the Moto G did support my 64GB SD card, despite not being officially in the specs. I did have to reformat it with the phone, but after that it worked just great. It's unusual for companies to under promise and over-deliver, so I wonder what's going on there.

In practice, however, the Moto G actually appears faster than the M4 Aqua, even in the 1GB configuration! In the end, between the camera and improved performance, I went with the Moto G. Later research showed that the Snapdragon 615 used in the M4 Aqua has severe throttling issues due to overheating, so I unwittingly dodged a bullet.

Since I was buying in a hurry to replace a dead phone, I ordered the black version from Amazon rather than going through Moto Maker. It's also much easier to return something to Amazon than to Motorola, so that was a consideration.

The phone itself is fast, as fast as the Xperia Z1. Installing software, starting up software all felt faster than the Z1 (undoubtedly helped by not having to push as many pixels), while task switching was surprisingly quick with no latency experienced. The camera was about as fast as the Z1's, though obviously picture quality isn't anywhere close to the benchmark set by that camera. The twist to shoot gesture is a nice gimmick, and I thought it to be useless but to my surprise after a few days with the phone I could shoot with the camera while cycling! Video is surprisingly good:

By far the biggest issue with the phone is sluggish bluetooth pairing. In fact, for both my cars and the SBH52, I had to reboot the phone in order to do a pairing. Neither the Logitech X100 nor my vivoactive (which unfortunately needed a factory reset to unstick its pairing from the Z1) needed such a reboot. Once paired, the pairing sticks, so at least this is only a one time problem.

Sound quality is, not surprisingly, lacking compared to the Z1, but not so much so that I found it objectionable. Some have reported annoying cross-talk when plugging in headphones into the microphone jack. I was prepared to have to do without (most of my listening is via blue-tooth over the SBH52 anyway), but when I plugged in headphones it sounded just fine.

To my surprise, going from the Z1's 1080p screen down to the 720p screen didn't bother me at all. Of course, watching movies on the Z1 has always drained the battery so fast that I rarely did it, and in any case to save storage I'd always watched movies in 720p.

Motorola is well known for providing a near-stock Android experience with no additional UI tweaks. I didn't expect this to make a big difference to me, but it does and is a pleasant welcome after the Sony modifications to the OS. I also expect that this also contributed largely to the higher performance of the UI and software despite the supposedly slower processor.

After my experience with the Z1, which begged to be recharged nearly all the time, so much so that I put the phone into stamina mode full time, any change had to be better. The Moto G was disappointing at first, barely lasting  12 hours without a charge. But 2 charge cycles later the battery life improved dramatically, with me typically ending the day somewhere around 40-50% of battery life. On a heavy use day it'd drop to 15%. This is a huge improvement over the Xperia Z1, and makes use of say, the Garmin Livetrack feature much more feasible than before. With the Xperia Z1, even with stamina mode, I was unlikely to make it to the end of the day without a mid-day recharge. Lithium ion batteries will generally lose 20% of their capacity after 300 recharge cycles. If your battery is barely able to get you through the day, after a year, your battery will absolutely not get you through the day. And yes, this applies even if you're the type to keep it plugged in as often as possible. The relatively long battery life of the Moto G means that you can expect to get at least 2 years of use out of the phone before the non-replaceable battery starts to lose enough charge capacity to be annoying.

All in all, given the price of the phone and the features (waterproofing is huge for me), the performance of the phone is such that I will be happy to hang on to it for a good long time. I expect that if you manage to buy this phone during the inevitable black friday sales, you'll get it for a significant discount which will be an even better deal.

Recommended.","4.0 out of 5 stars"

The phone will eat your battery alive, apps will run slow as molasses, apps will shut down for no reason, buttons will not respond properly, the great ""chop"" feature to activate the flashlight fails to work, and, worst of all, the option to move apps to the SD card disappears. The SD card is a huge draw for this phone, and its clunky performance after the update is a full-on deal breaker. The 16 GB version might hold up better and retain better performance with the update, but this 8GB version just falls apart in almost every respect. What a bummer. I am going to try to figure out a way to reset the phone to the previous Android version. If that doesn't work...well I got six good months out of it for less than $200. Funny to think that subsidizing a phone would have been a better deal in this scenario though. Motorola should have held back on this update for sure. I am definitely going to think twice about buying another one of their devices.","2.0 out of 5 stars"

**Addition

I have had the 16 GB version of this phone for a little over two months now and overall I am satisfied. For the price, this is a very reliable phone which will do pretty much everything you want from a smartphone with very few hiccups. I can't emphasize enough that you MUST get the larger storage option, between the ridiculous app size of certain social media apps and the size of the OS (about 4.19 GB) you really won't be left with much wiggle room if you stick with the 8 GB size.

Pros:
Good reception on calls never had a dropped phone call (T Mobile US)
Reliable OS (virtually no force closes) also minimal bloat apps on it (which makes me wonder why the OS partition is so large...)
Surprising battery life on standby--typical battery life with normal use.

Cons:
Touch reception can be a little wonky sometimes, when I mean to scroll up or down the phone sometimes registers a ""click"", very annoying with the many videos and links embedded on the internet and social media.
Camera doesn't always work well with camera non Motorola camera apps, especially google's app.","4.0 out of 5 stars"

On November 22, 2015 Rita and I bought 2 Moto G cell phones from Amazon.com.  During the last three weeks we have been using these new phones on the Ting Cell Phone service network.  We decided on buying these phones based on the excellent reviews on Amazon.  There was one excellent review with a Youtube link where the reviewer showed the water resistant capabilities of the phone by dropping it in a bowl of water while playing a Youtube video.  Needless to say the phone still worked and continued to play the video while in the water.
I was surprised when I loaded a sshd server on the phone along with termux when I saw the amount of security that is incorporated with the Android OS.
Moto G Security Features

SE Linux
SE Linux is Security Enhanced Linux developed by the NSA.  SE Linux is one of the security tools that is excruciatingly hard to set up properly. Once it is set up it makes the system virtually impregnable to attack.  I was happily surprised that even when I logged in over ssh as root, I was not the root user.  I started to look around the /etc directory and saw properly configured SE Linux files.

Encrypt Cell Phone
There is a security feature that enables you to encrypt the entire cell phone which is the same as encrypting your hard drive or selected partitions.  This feature makes turning on your cell phone a little harder since you have to enter a password/phrase to boot the phone.  I'm a strong believer in encrypted drives and partitions and the use of AES-256 is pretty good encryption.

Features:
Camera with front and back lenses
Flashlight
Pre-installed google apps including
  Google plus
  G Mail
  Chrome Web Browser
Voice recognition opens with, “OK Google.”

This is a great phone that is a great buy for about $175.00 on Amazon.  Rita has told me several times that she loves her new phone.  I have added signal by Whisper Systems, Gnu Privacy Guard, and Rsync Backup to both phones so that I can backup both phones and have secure encrypted communications.  I would recommend for anyone looking for a new phone to buy this one.
  Have a great day

- Latest version of Android (5.1.1 Lollipop)
- Reasonably priced
- Fast and fluid response
- No bloatware
- LTE support
- Supports most networks (Digicel Trinidad works!)

Cons
- I haven't encountered any problems yet to make me regret this purchase. As time passes, I will see. I've heard a lot about heating and lagging issues but these remain to be seen. For what it's worth I forward most of my apps to the SD card and the only problematic app is Google Camera (available on Play Store) which crashes whenever I try to go into its settings so I've defaulted to the included camera app.

Verdict
I really can't find any fault with the Moto G 3rd gen unit, although I think the included charger could have been both an adapter and cable (instead of having the cable made on to the adapter), beyond that I have absolutely no complaints and I'm loving this handset. Good job Motorola!","5.0 out of 5 stars"

I read a lot of reviews about this phone and I also visited the Motorola website. After taking my time and actually trying one in a store I decided that my needs could be filled with an unblocked GSM Moto G phone with the 14 GB of memory and the ability to add the 32GB memory card. I would recommend if you can stretch your budget to the 14GB you will be happier than having the 8GB model. By the time we download apps etc the memory soon fills up. It is nice to be able to migrate some of the memory to the memory card therefore keeping the internal memory down. I have only had this phone in use for one week but the fact of the matter is I love this phone. I thought it would be too large however I purchased a soft sided belt pouch and it fits on my waist perfectly. I like the fact that I could choose the provider and I stayed with Tracphone. This to me is my first real smartphone so I am like a kid with a new toy. I would like to thank those folks who added positive reviews about this phone helping me make my final decision. If you are in doubt about choosing a phone and are not a super major user and need lots of memory I recommend this phone.

He didn't drop it, or stress it in any other way.  The repair is 1/2 the cost of the phone.  He's very bummed.  We get that this is life with smart phones but it doesn't mean we have to like it.  Overall, the phone is good, very good but the gorilla glass is not as strong as the name implies.","2.0 out of 5 stars"

I had the 1st gen, and it's pretty much the same thing a little bit better. The camera and zoom still sucks. And I completely loathe their stupid design idea for the back of the phone. They added little annoying diagonal lines which makes me shiver every time I touch them. If you're not sensitive to certain plastic surfaces, I don't think you're going to have the same problem as I do. The screen is also gigantic, I kind of liked the 1st gen better. You can't use your charger cable as a usb as well, which is not a bad thing since I have 5 of those, but they could've added a usb cable to the box. There's also no earphones in the box, or I've lost them (unlikely).

The product is a little different from unboxing versions on youtube. I'm not sure why, but don't trust your phone will be like those in videos if you buy'em here.","3.0 out of 5 stars"

I considered opening up my Nexus 5, unscrewing things and getting a new battery, but had held off waiting for what the Nexus 5X would bring. In the meantime, I went on a questionably unsafe hike where it then poured and my Nexus 5 got more than a little wet. Needless to say, I needed a new phone as my Nexus 5 now had more than battery issues.

I settled on the Moto G 2015 16GB, 2GB RAM version directly from Motorola. Motorola lets you custom design your phone with multiple color choices, storage, engraving, etc. I went with a white face, blue back and champagne metal accent. Easier to find I figure than my old black rectangles. Designing is simple and easy and the changes update real time with a 360 rotation.

Ordering the Moto G was a snap, and in less than a week I had my Moto G in hand.

SHINY EXTERIOR (or not really):

The Moto G 2015 sports a 5” gorilla glass screen at a 1280 x 720 resolution for a 294 PPI. This is quite low compared to other phones out there, but the Moto G is also 33% or 50% of their price. Furthermore, higher resolutions require more powerful chips to run and suck up more power. Part of the reason I went with the Moto G over waiting for the Nexus 5X is because the Nexus 5X is rumored to have an even higher PPI than the Nexus 5 resulting in likely worse battery life. I can tell the difference between the Moto G and the Nexus 5 screens if I look real hard, but it doesn’t bother me. Screen to body ratio, or how much of the face is screen vs non-screen is 67%. Edge to edge screen this phone is not.

Now the back is way different from my Nexus 5 in that it’s textured and easy to grip unlike the smooth backing of the Nexus 5. Still plastic, but I don’t see a problem with that at all. The texture however is likely to accumulate all kinds of gunk and dust, so I’m putting mine in a case as soon as it arrives. The backing comes off revealing a micro SIM and MicroSD ports. You can order additional different color backings directly from Motorola to customize your phone and change the colors based on whatever you feel like.

The phone’s backing is curved with the audio port on the top. The top of the phone also curves down making audio port buttons like the Pressy PB01 The Android Smart Button Compatible with Galaxy, HTC, and Nexus Smartphones, Black not viable.

Power button is on the right above the volume up and down. Speaker (unknown if mono or stereo at this time) and microphone are front facing with respectable sound. Front facing with along with a 5 MP at f/2.2. The back camera is a 13 MP at f/2.0 with dual flash.

Weight is fairly average at 5.5 oz.

There is no notification light. So the ability to glance at your phone and see whether an email, text message, Facebook post, Instagram post or anything you’ve assigned an LED light color is flashing is now gone. In its place, the screen will now selectively turn on a small portion of the screen with the icon of the application when a notification comes in. Not as useful by far, but still better than nothing.

GUTS, WIRES, & SILICON:

The Moto G is running a quad core Qualcomm S410 which is a fairly low to midgrade processor with a Adreno 306 graphics chip. The S410 is actually quite a big improvement over the S400 despite being granted just 10 higher in the naming nomenclature. The S410 uses 64 Bit computing, is a quadcore vs dual core, better efficiency and uses ARM v8 which is a superior instruction set. Basically, don’t be fooled by the low processor number, this processor can handle most peoples’ daily routine. Don’t expect to run mobile high performance games at max here, but this will easily handle mundane tasks. Furthermore, remember, low to midgrade processors tend to be more power efficient leading to, you guessed it, better battery life.

Depending on the model you get, it will either be the 16GB/2GB Ram model or 8GB/1GB Ram model. I strongly suggest getting the 16GB/2GB Ram model. The 16GB model only had 11.81 GB free after OS. Android doesn't run all that well under load with just 1 GB of Ram.

Battery is rated at 2,470 mAh and is fairly impressive in how long it takes to drain the battery. With a lower resolution screen and a low to midgrade processor, the battery life on a sub 3,000 mAh battery phone is very impressive. Battery is NOT removable. After extended use of this phone, two days is plausible if you aren't a big movie or game player. I get up at 6:30 in the morning and after checking email, Facebook and a few other apps, my phone is down to 95% by 9:00 am. Finishing my day at 5:00 has my phone down to 83% despite usage all through the day. Turning into bed at 10:00 pm has the phone down to 68%. I can go two days without a recharge, but I'm also not streaming video or playing games. Your mileage will of course vary. The reviews aren’t kidding about “all day battery.” See my screenshot for more information. 31% usage on 15 hours with frequent, but short usage.

As usual, there is the standard Bluetooth, WiFi and GPS/GLONASS. iFixit hasn’t done a teardown of the 2015 Moto G, so I cannot be sure who’s making what chip. Odds are though it’s Broadcom providing the Bluetooth/GPS chip. There is NO NFC. I found that I rarely used NFC on my Nexus 5, so not a big deal to me. There’s an accelerometer and the regular gambit of sensors. There is however an FM radio that doesn’t rely on WiFi or a data plan. It does however require you to plug in headphones as they act as the antenna.

The specification page says that the phone works with microSD cards up to 32GB. This is inaccurate. I currently have a 64GB microSD card working perfectly with over 30 GB of music on it. You will need to have the phone format the microSD card first before you can start moving files on to it. The Moto G 2015 apparently only reads FAT32 format which Windows will not format a larger than 32GB memory card to. Motorola I believe stated that up to 32GB as some larger cards may perform inconsistently.  See my photo for more information.

THE DIGITAL BITS, SOFTWARE:

Motorola has adopted stock Android+, where the + is a few optional Motorola apps which are relatively useful. There is no Samsung Touchwiz, or LG, HTC or other manufacture skin on the phone that so regularly slows down devices running such skins. So if you like stock android, this is a huge benefit, out of the box virtually stock Android. My model shipped with Android 5.1 Lollipop. You get to decide what your phone looks like, the power is yours.

Motorola has included a few Motorola apps which are pretty useful in learning your routine to keeping the screen off during your regular sleep hours, what to do based on certain motions of the phone, who’s calls and text messages to block and let through based on your calendar and so on and so forth. The best thing is that none of these are mandatory and you can completely ignore them should you wish to. It’s all up to you.

USB OTG is enabled, but you do need a third party software package like the Nexus Media Importer application to read USB hard drives and flash drives. Mice work without any additional software. The microUSB port will not however connect through a wired CAT5 adapter to the internet (or at least mine didn’t play nice).

If you’ve previously been on an Android phone, the transfer is super simple via either the built in app “migrate” or by Google’s cloud backup. The real nice software bit is that you don’t have to install every Google App in this process. Don’t want Google Keep/Wallet/Etc? Don’t install it.

CONNECTIVITY:

The phone will work with GSM and CDMA carriers, which includes all of the four major carriers in the US and their subsidiaries.

Be aware T-Mobile and other GSM buyers, if you order directly from Motorola, you’ll get the XT1540 model which DOES NOT HAVE BAND 12. That band is required for voLTE which is a higher bandwidth form of data. Regular LTE and HSPA+ are supported. The CDMA version does have band 12 but lacks many of the bands to access GSM carrier frequencies.

LOOK MA, I'M A PHOTOGRAPHER, THE CAMERA:

The camera is a 13 megapixel at f/2.0 with dual flash with a front facing camera at 5 MP at f/2.2. Low light shots are mediocre at best, but well to moderately lit environments has the camera performing at a $500 smartphone level (see photo). Autofocus is reasonably fast and flash is bright.

Stock software includes HDR, Panoramic, video recording as well as built in a QR/bar code reading software. There is no image stabilization software which may create some blurry photos, but you may be able to find some camera software app that can mitigate that.

Considering that this phone costs $179 for the 8GB/1 GB Ram model and $219 for the 16GB/2 GB Ram model, the camera is beyond expectations.

OH CRAP I DROPPED IT IN WATER, OH YEAH IT'S WATER RESISTANT:

It’s amazing that a $179-219 phone is shipping with IPX7, which allows for 30 minutes submersion in fresh water without damage. How many people themselves or know someone who has damaged a smartphone by getting it wet? I’m guessing nearly everyone. With the Moto G 2015, you can carry on like normal when it rains, not freak out when someone spills a drink, and wash your phone under the faucet should it get dirty. Why can’t every brand follow Motorola on this?

NOW FOR SOME CELL PHONE PHILOSOPHY:

This phone is rock bottom cheap. But it’s not $199? Guess what? Phones selling for$199 never cost $199. They were really $500+ and $649 phones being sold at $199 with contract were in reality over 24 months well over $700. The $199 iPhone is a myth designed to sucker people into buying a phone and paying more than retail for it. John Ledger at T-Mobile bust this myth open and everyone is following him.

Now, the question is, will this budget phone do the job? Ask yourself, what do you primarily do on your phone? Text? Calls? Email? Browsing? Youtube? WeChat? Amazon? Facebook? Candy Crush? Tweet? Instagram? If you answered yes to any of those, this phone is for you. Why spend $649 on a high powered phone that you will not use the capabilities of? Save that $430 and spend in something you will like gas, rent, food, etc. Or even better, invest it and when you need a new phone, buy it with the earnings from your $430 investment.

Buy smart, and buy what you need and what you’ll actually use. And odds are, this phone will fit your needs just right at an absurdly low price.

TLDR:

Pros: Cheap, awesome battery life, decent camera, water resistant, back plate customization and microSD card

Cons: No voLTE, no notification light, no NFC, no removable battery, midgrade resolution and midgrade performance","5.0 out of 5 stars"

very minimal phone. with almost pure android, which is very important to me.
the screen is nice and bright. looks very good. not flagship good but very good for the price.
the interface is almost pure android. think nexus line interface with a couple of motorola tweaks. i didnt use the tweaks, but they are unobtrusive and few.
phone is not blazing fast. it is nimble though, and worked well. again, for the price.
camera is decent. i do not use cameras for serious picture taking.

the ""bad"": 8gb of internal storage fills up very quickly. i knew this when i bought phone and so took nothing off in terms of number of stars.
the 1gb of RAM was also very little, but again, i felt it was worth the price and felt it was appropriate for the price point.

Pros:-
1.Stock Android:- Very smooth and snappy on the Moto G.The animations are very smooth and there's barely any lag or stutter while using the phone on daily basis.
2.Updates:-Motorola has always been great with updates and even this time, the Moto G 2015 should get the Android 6.0 Update soon after the official launch
3.Amazing Battery Life:- I could easily touch 5 hours of screen on time with AutoSync On, Wifi On, Bluetooth On(with my Moto 360).On a heavy day with 3G data and no wifi, I could still get more then 4 hours of Screen on time over a 13-15 hour long day.Even my LG G4 or the Galaxy S6 cannot touch this type of battery life on my normal usage.
4.Decent internals:-The Snapdragon 410 and 2GB of RAM do a great job when it comes to daily use and multitasking.I could play most of the games on the phone without any issues and overall, for $200, You can't ask for more.
5.Expandable Storage:- This is a huge plus on the device as you can add upto 32GB of Memory Card along with the 16GB of internal storage
6.4G LTE and Dual SIM
Cons:-
1.Camera:- While decent in daylight,The low light performance is poor and the Motorola Camera app is something that I don't like that much
2.Display:-The 720p IPS Panel is not that sharp and crispy and contrast/color reproduction is poor too.But at this price point, I think this is fine

Overall, at this price point,The Moto G 2015 is a great buy.For more in depth coverage,including camera samples, Do watch my full review of the phone here:-http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zxvkvzr1OPk","4.0 out of 5 stars"

Battery Life: By far of all the phones I have used, this has the best battery life. Even after 36 hours of use I seem to have like 25-30% battery charge left. I am charging the phone alternate days. With my previous smart phones, battery was always an issue.

Motorola Migrate App: When I bought this phone, the migrate app did everything for me from moving photos, music, etc from my old phone to this phone. It was effortless and so easy to use.

Signal Strength: Where I live, we do not have the best signal strength. Some spots in my home have better signal compared to other spots. The signal strength in this phone is better than my old Samsung Galaxy S3 and A5.

I am very happy with the phone and am glad that I switched from Samsung to Motorola.","5.0 out of 5 stars"

Screen navigation also became difficult as it required odd use of the navigation buttons to switch from the phone to apps and back again.This all may have developed because of it updating to Android 6 but that may just be a coincidence. I thought that paying less than $200 for a Motorola phone would be a great bargain but I've decided to switch to an iPhone to gain back some reliability and predictability. I guess we all get what we pay for.","2.0 out of 5 stars"

I was told by Motorola that  it was factory-defective. I returned it to Motorola and after calling (paying long distance calls), paying 68 dollars to FEDEX it back, countless hours on email, chat and phone, Motorola finally shipped a replacement over three weeks after they received the defective phone. The 2nd phone didn't connect either. After doing my own online research and talking to 2 more Motorola agents, they finally admitted MOTOROLA DOES NOT MAKE A GLOBAL GSM UNLOCKED MOTO G 3!

In the midst of this disastrous customer experience, AMAZON on the other hand has been AMAZING! They actually shipped me another phone and when they heard it is useless to me, offered to refund me completely.

However, the phone itself is great, if you live in the USA. After owning 2 MOTO G 2nd gens, I was thrilled to get this latest version with upgrades and improvements AT THE SAME PRICE. The phone is well -built, feels solid and comfortable in my hand, it's super-attractive (now with the optional custom build), has a much improved camera over MOTO G 2 (which I also loved) and now has the all-important water-resistance (which I have not had occasiont to test).

After almost 4 years I decided to ditch my S3 for a new unlocked phone. I am grandfathered with AT&T with a low cost plan and given the rip off for new smartphones now imposed by the carriers better get a generic unlocked phone. The deal was quite attractive also.
Don't get me wrong there are a lot of good things about this phone and Android 5.1.1. It is fairly fast and the screen resolution while low is adequate for most common usage, but if you are a casual user like me, on the lazy side when it comes to configuring a phone, you are up for a bad surprise.
So after more than a week of tinkering with it, here are the things that may or may not turn you off.
1. Power button: it is small and on the side. You'll have to use it all the time to awake your phone which is just a terrible annoyance. I tried many of the double tap/gyroscopic apps to alleviate that issue but nothing really gives you the ease of having just a front button like the premium brands.
2. Android 5.1.1 is a very ""basic"" product on that phone, and you'll have to spend hours reconfiguring it to get close to what you could have with a premium brand phone. Quite honestly most of the redesigned apps like mail, calendar, clock, Music, Camera... suck. Examples: you cannot use a mp3 file as your awakening music with the Alarm app. The old eMail program is gone replaced by the Google Gmail app which does not provide you with a clear view of your email accounts when all combined (you cannot figure out which email belongs to what account), there is also no mass selection and deletion. You cannot have a year view in your calendar, you need to flip through every single month (huh!). There is no decent weather widget. Google play cannot open on My Library and the standard playlist are just dumb lists without real sorting options. There are very limited ringtones and notification sounds, etc...you go the picture. All that to say that you are going to spend a lot of time downloading better apps, if you can find ones, to address these issues.
3. this is not a slim phone, but this is probably due to a more powerful battery...that you cannot change !
4. the phone is difficult (almost impossible) to read outside in bright light.

Now there are things that I like:
- being able to act on email and messages from the Notifications drop-down. This is real a plus!
- the dreamscreen that shows you key notification info without having to unlock the phone.
- Battery life is pretty good. But this is just the beginning and they are usually always good for the first month or so.

Now, I will probably keep it because it was cheap, did not change my contract and because I am not a intensive user of it.
But beware of the limitations.","3.0 out of 5 stars"

I am the owner of the HTC One M8 (2014) and, if it was not for the limited space available even with a SD card, I would purchase one for myself to replace my HTC.

Read: I am HIGHLY impressed with this phone.

If you are on a budget, or your primary phone was destroyed and you do not wish to pay a $100-$200 insurance claim to get your phone replaced ($175 to replace a HTC One M8 through T-mobile), then just buy this phone. Great price, great phone for under $200.

UPDATE:

Bought this for my wife and then went on a 4 month deployment. She used it for a total of 7 months now. This review is only for the quality of the phone as I have not played around with it too much.

 I have an HTC One M8 that is 90% all metal so that is where my expectations are.

Quality: Aside that it is a plastic cased phone, the plastic has held up exceptional. I would put it on par with more expensive iPhone and Samsung devices. The glass has no shields on it and has absolutely no scratches. This is surprising to me as my wife typically throws her phone in her purse unguarded against foreign sharp objects. She uses her phone a lot, and also lets our 4 year old use it as well. Anyone with 4 year olds know that they have a tendency to randomly throw phones when they do not do what they want them to do.

The back shell has never fallen off... something I have seen Samsung phones do.

The SD card is still working well inside the phone. Phone still works buttery smooth... I am a little jealous because, at times, my HTC gets bogged down... then again, I am an app happy android fanboy.

Sound is actually really loud. I have the HTC boom speakers on my phone, and while the Moto G does not have dual surround sound speakers, they are almost as loud as mine... and do not sound all that bad.

I would buy this again!

This is an awsome unlocked phone. I was a little hesitant to switch over to an unlocked phone and was not sure how this would work. I have AT&T as a carrier and my contract has Expired and I needed a new phone.  In my prior contact I did not have a data plan and used just basic phone and text.  Purchased this Moto G and inserted my existing SIM card. I was up in running in about 5 minutes after the initial customization of the phone features.  This phone has built in WiFi and I am able to use it as a full blown smart phone, except I don't have the $45 / month data plan charges.  The other thing that I have discovered is that when I am away from home, there are free hot spots just about everywhere, so I have had no problems using as a smart phone when out and about.  Another nice thing I discovered it that I have Cox Cable for my home ISP. In Las Vegas were I live Cox as hundreds of Hot spots all over the city and I am able to tap into these as a customer of internet. So overall it pretty awesome to have a smart phone, without a costly data plan and basically very little limitations.  I pay about $20 a month for unlimited phone and text and with the built in Wifi and all the hots spots I have a full blow powerful phone.

My only regret is that I should have purchased the 16Gb model, because now I am discovery all kinds of new apps that I can use. Note, I have inserted a 32Gb micro SD so this gives me expanded capacity. My wife who also has a passionate hate for droid devices after seeing my phone and its capabilities decided to purchase one for herself, and now she has been converted. She loves it, of course she purchased the 16Gb model and then she plugged in a 64Gb micro SD, which by the way the phone supports with no problems.","5.0 out of 5 stars"

I ordered it directly from Motorola and it came in about five days. It was seamless to set up.  What I absolutely love about this phone is that I live a very active lifestyle, and it is so durable (yeah I dropped it the first day I owned it.  Twice. Everything still in tact!). I had a few iPhones and Samsungs and I got tired of watching their batteries drain and their screens shatter when dropped....enough.  Time for something different.

More importantly for me:  I can use this phone all day long and not even have to charge it once!  The battery life for this phone is absolutely stellar!!!!!  The camera is good too...taken it hiking, even in misty rain, and it held up perfectly.  Of course I am definitely not going to dunk it in water for 30 minutes ... but I was pleased that the misty moisture didn't ruin the phone.

Dollar for dollar I don't think this phone can be beat. I paid less than 200 ... a third of what an iPhone costs!!!.. I was with Straighttalk Wireless, but switched to Cricket (AT&T) for $35.00 a month autopay when I bought this phone so I'll save 15 bucks each month!

I don't use a cell phone much so maybe my strategy won't help many people, but I only pay $3 a month for phone service with H2O. Add to that the cost of an unlocked Moto G and It works out to $18 a month for one year.
All I had to do was turn off the cellular data setting so I don't get charged $0.10 per Mb. The phone works great on wifi, and there are some great GPS apps that work offline.

The main reason I bought this phone was because so many websites was calling it the best phone for under $200. Problem was it sold out so fast and when it finally came back in stock Motorola's website (where you could customize your phone) wouldn't work half the time. Also, no longer was the phone $180 before taxes but $219 on Amazon which meant the phone ended up $230 by the time I hit checkout. Probably could have been patient and waited for one at a lower price but didn't want to risk it selling out again.

What I like most about this phone is several things. The 5 inch 720p screen is really nice for watching HD movies. The lake of practically any bloatware is a godsend and therefore feels like you really get the most out of the 16GB than you would with any carrier phone. Speaking of which I love how it's unlocked. Right now Cricket wireless probably has the best plans you can get when you consider their prices and the fact they use AT&T's network, however they're phones are horrible so this allows me to enjoy both worlds. That said, now that T-Mobile is allowing unlimited Pandora streaming and rumor has it soon unlimited Netflix streaming, I can switch over to them if I wanted and still use this great phone. Performance wise, this thing hasn't slow down or froze yet (Again keep in mind I have the 16GB with 2GB memory). I'll admit I pretty much use it only for phone calls, internet browsing, video watching, and navigation, but the few games I do have install on it run flawlessly (mostly old Nintendo/Sega games). The camera is fantastic during the day but does suffer in the dark. I also find Motorola's camera program not as easy to use as ZTE's or Samsung's. Battery life is not bad. Heavy use I get about a day out of it. Little use, three days. Finally I also like how I can expect to get some mileage from this phone at Motorola is claiming that it will support Android 6.0 Marshmallow once it comes out.

Overall I'm pretty happy with this phone but the recent price hike does hurt it's value. If you can get it for any price cheaper I say jump on it.","4.0 out of 5 stars"

It's absolutely worth paying double the price for a decent phone. I would return the phone in an instant, but due to traveling circumstances, the return window has passed.","2.0 out of 5 stars"

This one is GREAT! Android is a great OS (I'm currently running Marshmallow). I haven't had an Android in about 5 years but I was able to quickly figure out how to adjust all the settings to my liking and get all the apps I wanted. I especially love that I can add more memory because I tend to take a lot of photos with my phone. Please note that adding memory does not increase the phone's processing speed. However, you can format your memory card so that you can have your apps on there as well as photos, videos, etc. I love that it is water resistant although I haven't tested that. It's good to know that a puddle won't destroy it.","5.0 out of 5 stars"

It's kind of sad and funny that the only thing this phone will do is flash a reminder of the company that made this piece of junk. Thanks for constantly reminding me not to buy another Motorola phone.

I'm also fairly irritated that after spending 30 minutes on the line with a moderately incompetent technician I was told the only option was to get it replaced by with a certified used phone. Didn't pay to have a used phone after 5 days. Very disappointing.","1.0 out of 5 stars"

I purchased this phone because the number of reviews and high star rating.
I don't have that many apps on it, no gaming apps, only facebook and spotify and still the memory is filled up with app data from the built in apps .. a modern android phone needs at least 32gb ...

My old Moto G functioned perfectly, I was just ready for a bigger screen. I love the screen and Marshmallow OS. I also like that this gives the option to come in white or black. Overall, I already knew what to expect since having had a Moto G before. It's a great smartphone for under $200 and it doesn't feel cheap. I have this on Cricket Wireless, so it fits my frugal phone budget needs. I put my SIM card in, updated to Marshmallow, and was good to go.

During the past month and a half I have used this phone (16gb/2 gig ram model) as my daily driver. It has a multitude of applications now installed - I use it for phone calls, emails, text messages, media streaming, social networking, etc...
THIS PHONE DOES NOT SLOW DOWN. You heard me right! I previously owned the Moto G (1st Gen LTE) and became frustrated after a few weeks as it became sluggish and weighed down either by multiple applications being open or an application that took up a lot of memory. This model... nope. It runs like butter!
The screen, while 720p, does a great job and looks good. It is not Samsung S6 quality, but then again, you are not paying an S6 price tag... I will live with the compromise.
The front-facing speaker is loud and clear. The touch screen is very responsive. The camera takes excellent pictures with good lighting; get it in really low light environments and you may struggle for a good, clear shot.
All-in-all you are getting an excellent phone for the price. Hell, you are just getting an excellent phone.
I have been an iPhone 5c in the past and really would say this phone is comparable. It is plastic but packs a high-end experience. It has a clean, simple interface. It is not bogged down by bloatware or useless gimmicks. You end up with a very reliable, sturdy phone that just works so damn well.
Enjoy this phone but I would encourage you to splurge the extra $40 on Motorola.com for the 2gb model.","5.0 out of 5 stars"

If you have a problem with it, dispose it and buy another (they'll love you for it-or better yet buy something else).  I had an issue, and sent it for factory warranty.  Moto Care says they will send a replacement ""like new"" phone.  They keep saying ""very soon"".  I have been waiting over two months.

LONG VERSION: Last summer, I switched from Verizon to Tmobile.  I bought two LG phones at the tmobile store-an optimus L90 and a Leon.  They work well, but I wanted something with a good camera and a screen that I could see in the daylight.  I noticed that the LG phones (8GB) filled up quickly, even though we don't use many apps.  I believe the Google apps are to blame for that.

So I found the Moto G and was impressed by the specs for the price (I refuse to pay laptop prices for a phone that is carried daily).  The only place I found a 16 GB version was on the Motorola website.  Ordered and waited 2-3 weeks.  Received in August 2015.  I am giving this 2 stars instead of 1 because I really liked the phone before it fell apart.  It worked perfectly, and I was reassured by the waterproof feature.  Around the mid-December the plastic trim piece surrounding the back camera lens came unglued.  I thought about fixing it myself, and thought well at four months the factory warranty should cover it.

I went to the Moto website and chose the return option (didn't want to throw good money after bad with exchange).  I sent it in Jan 4 and received an email with a RMA number and tracking website.  After two weeks, still no status changes per website.  I decide to call and was told they are waiting on a shipment.  Three additional calls over the following two weeks with the same story.  After a month I was escalated, but the story was the same.  They could not repair it, or replace it.  I asked for my phone to be shipped back unrepaired.  THEY COULDN'T DO THAT EITHER!  The rep informed me that they can offer a 8GB phone to use while I wait for the shipment.

UPDATE: I was offered a 16 GB phone three days after I got the 8 GB.  So I sent it back.  Didn't want to pay for expedite (mainly on principle-but I wonder if that is the best way to go).  So they will not send the replacement phone until they get return.

 I have waited 2 months for a working equivalent phone.  I have wasted $60 in service from Tmobile during this wait.  I would never have guessed that, when I dropped my phone to Fedex before Jan 1, I would still be waiting for a replacement in March.

It would seem that Motorola is standing behind their product.  And I do appreciate that calling customer service yields minimal hold time and minimal talking to a computer.  I have called in a dozen times and spend around two hours on the phone with them.  But at this point, I feel like I sent my moto g into a black hole.  I know this is a tough market, and the value on this phone is amazing.  But I am not ready to accept that a $220 phone is disposable.  Maybe it's just me...

UPDATE FOR APRIL FOOLS
I just got off the phone with customer service.  All this time and I never thought to ask for the supervisor of the escalation team.  Doesn't matter the answer is the same.  No phones to ship out.  Estimate 1-2 weeks.  That puts me at April fools or the week after for a phone I sent in last year.  I am the fool.

I did not want to admit defeat, but they got me.  I feel they should stand behind the product if they say there is a warranty.  There is no warranty.  Just smoke and mirrors.  They will steal your phone if you like.  I don't really have the money to buy another phone.  But that is what I am going to do.  I honestly don't believe they are going to ship me anything.  If they do, my confidence is zero that I can rely on such a shoddy product.

Please do not support this company.  My experience is real and it could happen to you.","1.0 out of 5 stars"

Some websites did not show correctly and performance on those sites were very slow. I later realized that the color depth (number of individual colors displayed) is extremely low on ALL websites (looks like 256 in contrast to the usual 16.7 million). It's not the screen but some kind software issue or other hardware limitation that I only experienced on the G 3rd generation. All Moto G 2nd generation are fine.
I contacted Motorola support to see if this is only true for my particular device or if it's the same for all devices. It took me endless chats, emails, screenshots and phone calls. I was forced by the service to do software updates and factory resets. Now, way over 4 weeks of back and forth they acknowledge that it's an issue with all of the phones. But they don't have a resolution. Actually I was just told that they will look into the fact if this issue needs to be resolved or if it's just within specs. What the crap.

And the OS, well, it's Android, so I am not sure how much the phone itself has to do with that, but I very much enjoy that as well.

My only concern is the battery. Only had it for a few months, and when I use it heavily (GPS Navigation, music streaming, maps) I get less than a day (8-10 hours). So if this is happening now, I wonder how bad it will be in another few months (1 year of ownership). But again, that is fairly heavy usage. I don't talk a lot on it, so that part of it is not as important to me.","5.0 out of 5 stars"

that is why i could not believe it when i bought the Moto G 3rd generation phone, i bought it again, just to make sure it was not, by mistake, a specific problem with the phone that i received.
a real disappointment. the phone is SUPER SLOW, un responsive.
reception got so poor that i feel like it is 20 years ago, cannot hear  any conversation. even when to my local provider, they tried everything, nothing helped
motorola transfer app copied my contacts 4 times. i had to delete everything and just use my google account contacts, cannot save anything on the phone.
very buggy, since it is so slow, for example: there is a new trick to make a sharp movement twice with the phone in order to switch the flash light - sometimes work, others not, sometimes with a delay of one minute....
notifications some times make a sound and sometimes not.
many features cannot be changed - i guess it has to do with the software - but it doesnt make this phone any more appealing.

I bought the Moto X for myself before this 3rd Gen was out and this is what I would buy for myself if I needed a new phone.  Battery seems to be longer lasting than my Moto X too.

My Moto X got an upgrade to the latest Android OS (6?) and the Moto G did not get a notification until about a month later.  I wondered if it would get the upgrade because of the length of wait.  It did and latest version of Android works great.

I got this because I was a bit tired of paying the hidden high cost of a smart phone device and this Moto G fits the bill for exactly what I wanted.  It is really convenient that it accepts the micro SD cards.  I put a 32GB card in it the day I gave him the phone and we loaded it up with his music and a couple movies for a trip.  He loved it.

It is great that you can direct pictures and video to write to the SD card and not the system memory.  It frees up the system memory for apps.

I would buy this again.  In fact I did, for my wife.  It works well for her too.

My only issue is in this day and age 8GB seems unreasonably small, given the low cost of memory.  This one has 8GB and my Moto X has 16.  This has little effect on performance but it does matter when installing apps.  16GB is more convenient even with the SD card slot in the Moto G (FYI, the Moto X does not have a SD option).  They should all have 32GB system ram these days.  There is no reason not too.  Add $10 to the cost if you must but it should not be necessary.","5.0 out of 5 stars"

At first, I was overly pleased to have this phone; everything worked as advertised, great LTE reception on Cricket here in Central FL...apps worked smoothly, pictures are OK, voice was clear, screen was just the right size, charge lasts about two days of normal use.....I was thrilled to have a great phone at a great price.

However, just three (3) weeks into this new phone I get a ""SD card suddenly unmounted"" message..which means that I can no longer access my SD card and all apps that were moved to it are unavailable. When I reboot the phone the SD card shows up in ""Data Storage"" in the settings...only to vanish with the dreaded ""SD card suddenly dismounted"" message a minute or two later.

This is obviously not a problem with the SD card, but the phone itself. I contacted Amazon and they are promptly sending me ""another"" Moto G3 phone....I am left to wonder what I will receive at my end..a refurb or a new-in-box replacement. We'll see.....

Anyhow, like I said I was initially thrilled with this phone but am happy that I waited to rate this item; I figured that I would wait for a month before I gave an honest rating. Glad that I did, as this phone didn't make it three weeks before there was a MAJOR problem.

Based upon the eventual outcome, I will change my rating to reflect what I finally end up with and what Amazon's final response will be.

To be fair, I hope to raise my ratings for this phone; Amazon has been responsive and I am only having to wait a few days for its replacement. We'll see how this turns out...

* UPDATE *
Well, Amazon got on the ball and sent me a brand new replacement within 72 hrs. I am impressed  !!!  Additionally, the new phone doesn't have the ""SD card suddenly unmounted"" message. Of course, neither did the phone I am replacing ( initially ). I am happy so far with Amazon's prompt response and if this phone works as it should I will update my rating to reflect 4 or 5 stars. Let's give this a month or two....

* 2ND UPDATE *
Well, I received the 2nd phone in  a timely fashion; but after three (3) weeks of use the same problem emerges: The SD Card won't work again. Works fine for awhile and then quits recognizing the card altogether. You can see the card temporarily when you reboot the phone, but it becomes unreadable after 1-2 minutes. There is absolutely nothing wrong with the card, either.

Contacted Amazon and they are sending me a third (3rd ) phone. If this one doesn't work then I will be receiving a refund.

For starters and the biggest of all is the wifi problems it has, every single wifi I was connected to the wifi speed was uselessly slow, like 2g speeds, across multiple routers and I worked with support for days trying to figure it out including hard resets, cache wiping, the works, nothing worked.  So I returned it, I also tried the alcatel onetouch idol 3 4.7 and that too has the same wifi problems as well, and the only thing I can think is that they both use the same snapdragon 410 processor, so there is some issue with the snapdragon 410 and lollipop where the wifi is extremely slow on it.  But the lte data is blazing fast, but I don't want to waste my limited data.  Also this does not have a notification light which sucks, the moto display doesn't pulse when you have notifications, only when you bump it.  I also had issues with the screen being not very responsive and having to tap things multiple times, also a nightmare for swipe texting.  Camera was also mediocre, not impressed.  Overall I think this phone has majorly missed the mark.  The wifi issues need to be resolved and the moto display needs to be tweaked so it pulses like a notification light than that would be doable.

For the price, I was not expecting much, but after using it for the past couple weeks I am very satisfied.  My previous phone was an Iphone 5C, and I accidentally dropped my phone and cracked the screen.  I'm with At&t, and did NOT want to do their new plan with At&t Next.  To get a new Iphone was something like $27/month for 30 months which is $800.  Their other phones are around the same price, and I really do not want to pay that much for a phone.  I really just use it to text, make calls, and check traffic.  I was also looking at a Lumia 640, but I am ultimately glad I went with this phone.  I like both phones, but the lack of apps on windows phones is a killer.  I don't use many apps, but the apps I use, I use frequently and aren't on windows phones.

Compared with my Iphone 5c, I actually find this to be a better phone!  I've read reviews saying you NEED to get the 16 GB 2 GB ram version of this phone, but I can tell you it's not very necessary unless you really use your phone alot and maybe do alot of gaming.  I got the 1 GB RAM, and it is more than enough for me.  The onboard 8 GB memory is not much, but I just bought a $10 microSD card and bumped it up to 32 GB.  The old Iphone 5 actually has the same 1 GB RAM, and this hasn't lagged at all even when i've had alot of applications open.

It took me a little while to get used to coming from an Iphone for the past 5 years or so, but I am glad I made the switch.  The camera is great, and I like how it's connected to the Google line of products.  I use Gmail and Chrome, and works seamlessly with their apps and I imported all my contacts and information from those accounts to the phone.  I started getting irritated with Iphones when they made that switch in the connectors.  I had alot of stereos and stuff that had those old connectors, then they switched to the lightning usb.  Also with Iphones, whenever theres a new Iphone and you update to the new IOS on your current one it happens to ""mysteriously"" slow down to a crawl and is not very usable.  Pretty sure they do this on purpose to get you to buy a new Iphone.  Anyway, I got tired of Iphones and am ultimately satisfied with this android phone.  It does everything I need to, and is pretty user friendly.  I just took to my local At&t store, and they put in a new sim card for no charge.  Have had no problems with service and calls are clear. Battery life is great","5.0 out of 5 stars"

MotoG has been developing a rep for problems with their SIM slots, and Consumer Cellular is big enough they should be able to produce ONE PIECE MICRO-SIM CARDS. There's no excuse to forcing customers to use flimsy 3 part SIM cards.

For under $10 I could get a precision adaptor from MicroSim-Shop dotcom. There's a video on how this works at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjLk-amds9k.  If Motorola would test and approve the use of THIS adaptor,  I will happily pay for the adaptors, wait for delivery, and finally install my SIM card. In that case we will stay with Motorola. Motorola would benefit even more than I, because they would have a solution to a problem for now and perhaps license the design for the next generation of phones.

However, if Motorola will not test the MicroSim-shop adaptor,  I'll have to find a brand with a better reputation for SIM slots and a better system and reputation for servicing their new phones.

I returned it for a replacement.  Amazon's replacement service was swift.","1.0 out of 5 stars"

The battery lasts long enough and I have not encountered any lag in the programs that I use routinely. The only things that I miss from is the AMOLED screen in the galaxy s5 which was pretty awesome, although the screen is good enough in this phone.

This phone works without any lag, after 3 months I just tried to use galaxy s5 again but that phone was so terrible, after one day I couldn't stand it anymore. In terms of the specifications samsung galaxy s5 is much better than this phone but in reality s5 lags and lags and lags.

If you have another $100 to spare and reading this in 2016, definitely try to go for a OnePlus 2 or even Moto X Pure. This phone is actually killer fast (and some apps even load faster than my OnePlus 2) but the main gripe most people will have in my opinion, easily is the 1. Screen (720p, way too outdated for 2016) and 2. Style (phone doesn't feel really premium at all, or sexy. It's pretty thick/bulky, and rounded. I know it's only around 200$, but I think it could have been sexier, take the OnePlus X for example.

Oh, and I forgot, I think the OnePlus X is even around this price range now.. .though it has some data/connection issues I hear (low speed/bands?). I would definitely advise to spend more $ since the 720p screen is way too dated and the phone is somewhat unattractive (white is more noticeable, black looks a bit sleeker).","5.0 out of 5 stars"

The phone responds smoothly for most tasks, but could show some lag in more memory intensive apps. The screen is good, camera is ok, not great. The rather disappointing thing for me is that the memory was partitioned so that only 4.5Gb of the 8Gb is actually available. Minus the memory consumed by built-in apps and you're left with under 2Gb of memory to work with. You can use an sd card for added memory, but you'll have to be conscious when adding big apps, as you'll have to install it on the phone first, then move to sd card. That being said, it looks and feels like a well built phone. A great value.","4.0 out of 5 stars"

Listed #8 best phone of 2015. This phone has very useful features. For example, whenever i take the phone out of my pocket it automatically turns on to this black screen which lets me know the time and notifications. if i need a flashlight or light of any sort i just shake it twice and i get the flash turned on.

I could be having a lot of fun when suddenly a great moment is happening. You take out your phone, have to turn it on and unlock it and find the camera app. Unless you have a phone with a camera in the lock screen. Now what? You got your phone out and  just when your about to take the pictures that moment is over. Don't miss another moment! With the Motorola Moto G you just spin it twice with the screen face down and BOOM! You have quick access to your camera.

I got the 16GB phone and still have extra storage with all the apps I have. It came with 2GB of ram. after downloading over 30 apps my phone is still running very smooth.

Before that I used galaxies and I never really liked the galaxy brand. Too many problems, bloatware was too heavy. I consider myself a pretty tech savvy guy and I really just wanted a phone that worked.

While my iphone never had any major problems other than slow down due to software bloat, my phone was nearing the end of its life. The phone began getting sluggish and I started having minor problems after the 2 year mark. So when I set out to look for a phone I did heavy research. Battery life, a simple experience and price where the factors I used to determine my selection.

After reviewing tons of Phablets, I landed on the Moto 3g and I never really looked back since.

So lets break down what this phone does right and what it just does okay.

What is does okay
--------
Camera - While not the most high end camera in the world, it certainly does the job. I was able to take some great pictures and if you don't like the camera then simply buy new software on the playstore. It's not the most high end camera but I can't really say much seeing as it works.

Screen - Coming from a Iphone users don't realize their screen maybe one of the best features. While this screen isn't bad, it certainly isn't great either. It gets the job done while just being a little above average.

No Verizon/Boost Mobile/Sprint Support - While not a huge deal breaker, I am little shocked this phone doesn't support all the carriers rather than GSM only. I am waiting for Moto to break out with a universal phone but maybe that will never happen.

What is AMAZING
----

Android 6.0 and Battery - I have no idea if it's doze or if it is the phone but damn. This battery is crazy on standby time. The usage isn't too shabby either. With Marshmallow and active display I can get 1% battery drain out of 3 to 4 hours of standby. That is amazing! My iphone when in standby using to go %5 every hour regardless of use or not. Moto wins in this department.

Speaker - While it is not the clearest speaker in the world. I am impressed by how loud the speaker can even get. I am so use to iphone bottom facing speaker that I am not sure I can go back to another phone that has one that isn't facing you. It makes a difference and it's more than you think.

The Experience - Even though many people might not understand this. I enjoy a very plain vanilla android with no re-skinned apps or anything just a pure android experience. Man does this phone deliver. It's snappy and fast. No studder, lag or anything. I am overly impressed that this $200 phone can bring the experience of a high end flagship device. Very impressive.

What it doesn't do
----
No finger print reader - Not a deal breaker for me. While I would certainly enjoy to see Moto head in that direction with the next device I wouldn't consider it a problem at this price point.

Quick Charge - A little sad that some kind of quick charge couldn't be thrown into the phone as it takes the phone a pretty long time to recharge something like 3 to 4 hours from dead which is kind of a pain but considering how the long the battery last it's not very hard to assume that I can get to a charger by night and just let it run.

Overall Impression
---

While there is lots of things to love/hate about this phone. No one can argue that this device feels like a much high quality item than what it really is. Essentially the feeling you will having owning and using this phone is why would I pay for a $700-800 device when I can get a comparable experience out of a device 1/4 the cost of most flagships?

I would never recommend this phone to a power user. But coming from a Iphone 5c this device offers me enough productivity and battery to be more than enough for your average consumer who doesn't want to blow the bank. If I could give half a start I would say that the few issues above take off about a half a star to make it a 4 1/2 star product but still worth more than 4 stars.

Buy this phone. You won't be disappointed.

--Update---

After spending about a week with this phone. I can tell you there are some huge issues.
Number One the phone is unlocked however it only works with GSM carriers. It's bigger brother the pure works on ALL carriers. That's right. ALL carriers.
Number Two the phone's moto specific software was apparently removed if you update to Android 6.0. As a matter of fact many Android 6.0 features were not even listed.

Want to wave your hand across the screen to wake? That's gone.
Want to move contacts from one phone to another? That's gone.
Want to name your phone Billy? That's gone.
Want to switch to Ambient Display that comes with Android 6.0? It's not even in the damn menu.
Want to wake up the phone? I hope you like hitting the side power button because your going to be doing it a lot!

I had high hopes for this device but sadly, I can see now. Spend the extra $200 and just buy the Pure/Play. Not only will you get a better phone but you'll get the whole moto experience without it being watered down. I am highly disappointed that not one review mentioned that this phone has a completely vanilla watered down moto experience. I know Moto is getting rid of many of their apps because of google and doesn't see the point in keeping them around but honestly, I was buying the phone for the extra functionality and this phone doesn't have it. The pure does. Seems like a gimmick to me, buy the more expensive phone.

Phone is unlocked. We just put in our AT&T SIM and good to go. Phone build is of good quality and phone operates well. Not super heavy but, not the lightest phone either.

Cons:
1. 16GB model costs significantly more - That's a rip because flash is oh so cheap nowadays. Just price gouging ""Apple Style"" because they can but, it has microSD slot so OK in the end. (Seriously, $179 for 8GB or $219 for 16GB you can by a lot of microSDHC flash for $40)
2. Unlocked phone so no warranty was offered at checkout - have to buy one separately. Square Trade has some for unlocked phones for around $35 here on Amazon - BBuy wanted $50 for a warranty if I purchased phone in store. That's a lot for a phone under $200.","4.0 out of 5 stars"

I just ditched my Nexus 5 for this and I am glad I did.  The 8 gb model is pretty much a Nexus 5 but a tad bit slower and no NFC or wireless charging.  The best thing about this phone is the battery and the notification screen that is part of the Motorola package.  I wish the 16gb / 2g ram was available when I got this phone.  Coming from a Nexus 5 I can notice that the moto G does lag some between transitions from apps.  Besides that, this is the phone I have been waiting for, it has clear calls, a nice loud speaker, notification screen and super long battery life I average ending most my days around 50% around light-moderate usage.  One more thing, I definitely notice the screen resolution is not as good as my Nexus 5 but after a few days I don't even notice the difference.

Pros:

Batter life
Notification Screen
Simple / no bloat ware
external sd card

Con:

Slightly laggy (enough to notice but not enough to make me regret or dislike phone)

I have had a problem with audio not working in Pandora / iheartradio but it works fine with amazon music so that may be an app problem, not a phone problem

So why only 4 stars?  My previous phone, which was a couple years older (Nexus 5) ran Hearthstone and Madden Mobile smoothly.  This phone does not.  I know it's a lesser phone, but it's also two years newer so in my mind it should be able to handle it.  They're still usable, but they aren't smooth as I would like.","4.0 out of 5 stars"

It can't even do simple things like give notifications when you receive texts, etc. Yes, I have the Moto app on.  Beside giving notifications, Moto should also allow for a small shake to turn on flashlight and camera. Have to shake the phone so hard, it's faster to just turn in on and input password.
I don't know if it's the software or hardware. Just know I miss my lost gen 1 because it worked.
The only thing that seems nicer is the camera. It's 4G instead of 3G so it's supposed to be faster. It seems somewhat faster, but it doesn't matter on trains, and that's how I travel a lot.
Read other reviews online, not just this site. That lack of notification light seems to be everyone's number one pet peeve. I don't understand how it's a feature that could have been removed. The Moto app in there will give you ambient display showing what's coming in on one quick blink, and you never see it again.
It bugs me enough to send it back. I was looking forward to the upgrade.","1.0 out of 5 stars"

You do get relatively smooth transitions between tasks within the phone because it's stock android, but you are limited on the storage. If you don't download music, games, or take TONS of photos, then you're fine with a few apps for texting, watching videos, taking a reasonable amount of photos. I really like the phone. For <$200 dollars, it's a fair offer.
Let me bring up the photos and picture reference for a minute. The camera on this phone is not good when compared to a Samsung phone (Galaxy S5 is what my other phone is). You can see the difference just by switching phones. If you're not that picky about how SUPER great the quality is of the image, then you won't be bothered by the image quality. The quality is standard/good to say the least.

Would I reccomend this phone? Well, depends on your situation. I would say yes if you're looking for a phone that's a cheap price with limited storage space and decent camera quality. Remember that you can always insert a micro SD card for extra storage.
I would say NO for an alternative phone if you're wanting to ""upgrade."" If you're planning to upgrade, lets say from an iPhone 4 or Samsung Galaxy s4 or 3 to something newer or ""better"" then I would look somewhere else. This phone is simply for the price. And with all that said, the price stacks up fairly well to what it's containing within the Moto G.","4.0 out of 5 stars"

The first was a BLU Life one. A good (for the money) phone, until I took the latest update. It locked up tight as a drum. Dead as a mackerel. I then decided to go with an established name. I read review after review. And this is what I decided on. There are apps out there that help extend the already long battery charge. I'm not much of a game player on the phone, so that may have something to do with it. Calls are crisp and clear. And the camera is exceptional, in my opinion. Without a rubber phone protector, it feels like it wants to slide out of pocket. It seems to me to process quickly, with very little lag. A good low budget phone. I've taken the time to learn how to operate it, and so far, it's flawlessExcept for this new Marshmellow update. It's been updating for two days. It seems to be stuck at 67%.

This happens to be my first personal smartphone, and my first Android one at that. Before this I had used an old iPhone 4S, which has acted as the home phone for many years now. My search for a new and affordable phone was an arduous one, so for my review I think I will be focusing on value and offer some input on the other options a buyer faces at this price range, and hopefully it helps someone make up their minds. But, before that I will be making little notes about my observations with the device itself. Edit: After finishing up my “little notes” I realize that this is pretty much an article and I am so sorry. Tl;dr I like it

Unboxing) The factory plastic screen protector seemed to be stuck onto the screen due to the weather and atmospheric changes during shipping. The screen protector is supposed to stick, I mean, but normally the pull tab is easy to use, but in this case it too was sealed to the screen. Why didn't they just let the tab extend past the screen so this doesn't happen? No matter, if one encounters this just get a piece of scotch tape and lift it up with that. I heard tell some buyers were worried about scratching their screen trying to pry under the tab, so I thought I'd mention this.

OS) Right out of the box this phone came with Android 5.0 as expected, a few days later I got the update for 6.0, installed that with zero issues. Buyers now may get 6.0 preinstalled. Set up was very simple and easy for a first time Android owner, as was playing around the interface and learning how to make things exactly how I wanted them. The OS is very clean of aftermarket software. Only a few Motorola apps exist, besides the default Google apps. All of these can be disabled at the least.

Storage) With the 16GB model, there was only 11.81 GB total space with 10.75 GB available to me. The OS itself uses the remaining 4.19 GB of space. There is an available SD card slot that is officially compatible with SD cards up to 32GB, however many users report that they can use a 128GB card with their Moto G just fine. Storage should not be an issue on this phone.

Battery) This phone has a 2470 mAh battery. Lasts fine for a couple of days of casual use (infrequent texting/calling, checking email and calendar, using calculator, etc), and a full charge takes around 3 hours. But if you have the chance you really should be topping it off to between 40 and 80 percent. I'd recommend you read up on how to care for your battery. Other phones may advertise batteries with a larger capacity, but that doesn't necessarily mean it will last longer. What also matters is what that battery is trying to power. Above I mentioned that the OS is very light, and below I will mention the...

Display), which is 720p (or 720x1280) on a ~5 inch screen. It looks relatively sharp, however 720p on a 5 inch screen is really pushing it. Any larger a screen or any smaller a resolution and it would look like crap. So they picked a good middle ground. A 1080p resolution would certainly draw more power, and a smaller screen would probably turn away the ever increasing amount of people who want bigger screens. It is supposedly an IPS display, however the quality of blacks (is this the contrast range?) seems to be poor, more similar to my experience with TN displays. There is no apparent screen door effect in normal use. Only if you stick your face a couple inches away from the screen just so you can find something to complain about. However you WILL notice the screen door effect if you try to use this phone for VR. 720p won't cut it for that. The screen will not wow you, but it definitely looks good and is more than sufficient.

Sound) There are two front speakers, but do not be fooled. The top speaker is for calls only, whereas the bottom speaker is what will play media and other sounds. It's really crappy as I expected. Upon connecting headphones however, (Which for the first couple of times might be a really tight fit. Make sure you keep pushing until you hear a snap. This sounds terrible doesn't it?) the sound drivers turned out to be pretty decent! I put my Sennheiser HD518s into these and while they don't sound as good as on my PC, music is still really enjoyable. This is something that, ideally, you shouldn't have to mess with blindly, but if one is using cheap earbuds try playing around with an equalizer. This has a big impact on sound quality and soundstage. Enthusiasts will not be impressed by the quality but they should also know better than to expect much more from a phone, especially in this price range.

Design)  This phone looks really good imo! The back has a textured feel that is perfect for palm grips. Place your index finger in the Moto Dimple and allow this to guide the rest of your hand under the phone. Very slip-resistant here. I favor a claw grip, and while the phone isn't huge, those with small hands or short fingers might have to operate with two hands. With a claw grip, I can almost comfortably traverse my thumb all the way around the device, with some adjustment. I believe the Moto E has an advantage here, on the sides. This phone has a smooth, sort of slippery finish on the sides which I don't appreciate at all. It at least definitely needs some textured areas on the corners for when you pull the phone out of your pocket. Huh, haven't seen a phone with that yet. The slim design, at approximately 1 cm naked, enables smooth insertion and extraction relative to the pocket. Besides the smooth sides, my only other gripe is that the back of the phone is not flat, so I cannot have it sit on the table and use it without having it spin around a little bit. There are probably cases out there to remedy this, however.

Camera) I'm not big on taking pictures or video so I can't say a lot here. It looks quite good. I do notice that the taken image always looks different than what is shown on the camera when I am taking it. The focus circle also does not always convey to me what exactly will be in focus, and is somewhat finicky. I prefer the iPhone's tap-to-focus because it immediately shows me what the image is going to look like, and it's faster and more accurate.

Reception) I keep hearing that Motorola phones have great reception. I live in a small midwest city surrounded by trees and all I ever hear about is how terrible everything is. That also includes cell reception. I'm with Consumer Cellular using AT&T towers and everything seems fine so far. Reception is a lot better in my home than the iPhone 4 on the same network (it displays similar connection but call quality and consistency is superior), and in town I've had zero issues as well. I can't really provide a chart of measurable evidence on this, only anecdotal, so if you put no weight on this factor then I don't blame you.

It's like the Wii all over again) I can karate chop the air and turn the flashlight on. I just did it. It works. Takes a bit of force though, you have to chop the air like you mean it. You can flick the phone a couple of times to turn the camera app on too. Doing this a second time will alternate between front and rear camera. Why would you do that though when you can just move your thumb over and press the button to do that? These are kind of finicky and you'll probably look like a dork shaking your phone around. But on the off-chance that it works the first time you will look awesome.

RAMBLING:
The Moto G 3rd Gen is a an enticing value at $180-$220 unlocked. But this price bracket is around the low end of mid-tier phones, and includes some fierce competition. Most notably, the ASUS Zenfone 2, Alcatel's OneTouch Idol 3 (which also has a lower spec $180-ish model), Sony's Xperia M4, Huawei's P8 Lite, LG's Nexus 5, and even Motorola's own Nexus 6.

Which phone you pick may come down to what you are looking out of your device. While other options, such as the Idol 3, may provide you a better multimedia experience with its better sound quality and higher pixels-per-inch count, and others boast very impressive yet affordable technical specifications like the Zenfone 2, I would suggest that the Moto G offers to be a more dependable and practical general-use phone. A strong battery life, Motorola's supposedly solid cell reception, good camera, slim yet grip-friendly design, water resistance (not waterproof), and a very clean (and currently up-to-date!) interface and operating system are the main attractions of this phone to me.

With that perspective, however, do you really want to spend upwards of $220 for a phone? Motorola itself offers great values with the older Moto E and Moto G lines. I guess what I am just trying to get at is that this phone is in a very awkward place.

So, if you choose this phone, what might you be giving up?  As far as performance goes, my Moto G just flies non-stop with 2GB of RAM (and many say this is true with 1GB as well). I've experienced no issues with this phone, even when gaming (to be fair I don't do much except Hearthstone and the occasional random puzzle games). I think you will be satisfied using this for general use. Power users probably won't be looking at this price range for a powerful phone in the first place. So if that's not an issue, what is?

1) The Idol 3, at very similar price points being $180 and $250 respectively, has a reversible display, meaning it is equally functional upside-down as it is right-side up. Many times I wish my Moto G had this feature, but to be fair it is a rare one and I only know it exists on the Idol 3.
2) The Moto G does not have dual SIM slots like the Zenfone 2, P8 Lite, or the Xperia M4 Dual
3) No fingerprint scanner as several higher priced phones have.
4) Does not have fast charging capabilities like many of the other phones I mentioned seem to do.
5) The Moto G does not have a replaceable battery, but neither do any of the other phones I've been talking about. This design seems to be necessary to ensure water resistance, however.
6) The display on this phone has too low a pixels-per-inch count for you to experience VR. You will have a screen door effect if you try, which ruins the entire point.
7) There is no NFC support (if you need this you will probably know about it already. I personally have use for NFC)
8) There also is no magnetometer. This worried some people about Google Maps not staying relative to your facing, as well as compass apps being nonfunctional. However both of these things work just fine on my phone.

What are you gaining then? An attractive and mostly functional design, customization through Motomaker, a strong, dependable battery, a good camera, and a clean operating system. And a karate flashlight.

I would suggest checking your preferred carrier's offer on this phone. Many carriers do not sell the 16GB model of this phone, but they may have good offers on the lower end model. Consumer Cellular, for instance, is selling the Moto G 3rd gen 8GB for only $150, last I checked. This is a great value for a carrier that has a demographic seeking simple and practical solutions, and the phone's performance definitely matches that sentiment.

The 8GB/1GB configuration is a better value than the more expensive model, which effectively only grants you 1 more GB of  RAM for $40 more, seeing as storage is not an issue with a microSD slot.

So one must ask, what are the benefits of this extra gigabyte? Well what RAM allows you to do, very basically, is to have your device do more things at once. If your phone has a small amount of RAM, it will become bogged down using resource-intensive apps or multiple smaller apps running in the background. Also, one must take into account that the performance of a phone will inevitably decline as it ages. Looking at my memory manager on the phone I see on average I use about 1GB. So 1GB is certainly enough for the number of background apps I have going, and many budget and mid-tier phones use this amount, but having 2 means that I will not become bottlenecked with my current usage if I need to use more, and it will take a longer time for my memory performance to deteriorate. It's also possible that if my phone had only 1GB of RAM, I could be using less on average and have a little bit of wiggle room, as my system will try to optimize performance. Overall a single gigabyte isn't a huge deal, but it's something to take into account because it does make a difference depending on how you use your phone.

If that's worth $40 to you and you really want this phone, go ahead. A little investment to add to the longevity of the phone's smooth performance. I think most people buying this phone would opt for the cheaper option regardless, as it is the much better value.","4.0 out of 5 stars"

We both love this phone. It's very simple in use, smooth and runs really fast.
I like the clean android, but there are some minor things that I think need to be changed:

- There is no option to make the phone ring at full(normal actually) sound. THe first seconds it starst slowly. I checked all the settings available and I can't find a solution inside the settings. Actually, this problem is alive also on my galaxy note 5.
There is a simple app in playstore, disabla increasing ring that solved the problem. However, you'll have to go to app's inside settings to hide it from notification bar, as it's irritating.

- Battery percentage can only be found by scrolling down the notification bar.

- I had some problems with bluetooth. The device is shown as ""available for pairing"" after some time ( 2-3 mins) and this made me agry.

- Battery life is great.
However, charging time is really a problem here, and this is the most epic problem in this phone. It takes a lot of time to go 100, as expected w/o quick charghe. Be ready for this if you plan to buy it.

Overall, this is an amazing device.It's hard for me to name it a budget phone, it is cheap, but it tottaly doesnt feel cheap.
I recomend you to get the 2 gigs of ram and 16 internal version, for extra 42$.
I hadnt found any lag yet. Even when I got my note 5 this year, I had some minor issues with it's keyboard, unlocking the device and etc.
$220 is really a nice deal for this phone.","5.0 out of 5 stars"

DON'T GET IT WET. Motorola will not stand by their IPX7 water resistance rating. This is about the only downside for this phone.
Words of advice, make certain that the back of the phone is snapped in place, especially on each side of the opening of the camera. This is VITAL. Even after a complaint to the BBB, Motorola did not care. If there is any water damage, at all, Motorola will tell you to get stuffed. Even though their own website for the phone shows pictures of the phone IN WATER. The phone is great. The manufacturer Does. Not. Care. I've got the BBB transcripts to prove it.
The only snail glitch I've found with the phone is that you have to be very precise with swyping the keyboard. Maybe because I have big hands and kind of thick fingers. Perhaps if you have smaller fingers, it would be easier. I have found that holding the phone so only the tip of my finger touches and not any of the side, then it's more accurate.

Many reasons, chief among them: 1) Screen is laggy and too sensitive when using web browsers. Very easily invokes hyperlinks when scrolling pages. 2) Very difficult to use with aftermarket car mounts. A ""cradle"" type mount is awkward because of the location of the volume control, forcing you to put it off-centered into the mount. Magnetic mounts don't work because they interfere with a magnetic sensor associated with the optional flip case that turns the screen off when you shut the cover. So, the screen shuts off when if you try to use it with magnetic mount. I have not found any setting to turn off the sensor. On paper, it seems like a decent phone: good price, NOT TOO LARGE, and admittedly has decent battery life. But I miss my Nexus 4.

Currently, only the 8GB / 1GB model is available for order on Amazon, so I had to order mine directly from Motorola.

My only serious gripe with this phone is with the availability of the 16GB / 2GB model.  It was back-ordered when I first tried to order it, in early August, and Motorola's website is pretty clunky with the order process.  It may allow you to go through the entire process, then tell you in the end that some part is not available, and not finalize your order.  Once you manage to place your order, they charge your credit card within 24-48 hours, mark the phone as ""built"", but don't ship it for maybe two or three weeks.  At least that was my experience and I have read many similar accounts.  If you question their customer service via online chat, asking about a ship date, expect to get some vague non-answers in some very bad English, but also expect to get a coupon off of accessories available on their website.  Overall I can't say it was a good experience.  I'd rather just order the phone from Amazon, get it in two days for free with Prime delivery, and not deal with Motorola's order system at all.

Having received the phone, though, I can say that I am perfectly happy with it.  It's my first Android phone, although I have limited other experience with my wife's phone and a tablet mainly used by my sons.  I manage both of these devices but don't use them very much.  My previous phone was an iPhone 5S which I used for two years.

I would say that my Moto G3 is superior to that iPhone 5S in nearly every way that matters to me, except that it doesn't have a fingerprint reader.  It is stable, fast, and hasn't given me any trouble at all.  I like Android 5.1.1 better than I was liking IOS 8.  I have used quite a few apps on it, and done some casual gaming, as well as basic use as a phone and texting device, without any issues.  Also it doesn't have 5Ghz wifi but I wasn't using that on my iPhone 5S anyway.  I sold my iPhone through Gazelle for $150 and got a brand new unlocked Moto G3 for $219.99.  I also switched from an AT&T 2-year contract to Cricket and that is saving me about $45/month for an equivalent network and data allowance.  So I'm happy with my new device, and with the money I'm saving by not upgrading to the latest flagship phone for $700 or a monthly fee spreading it out over time.

One word of advice on Cricket and other wireless carriers and using a Moto G, or a Moto E like my wife owns.  They will try to sell you a ""universal"" SIM kit with a nano-SIM and an adapter for micro-SIM slots.  Don't use these adapters in these Moto phones.  Motorola tells you directly not to use them, and people tell horror stories about getting them stuck and breaking the pins in their SIM slots with them.  Of course their phone support and people at their retail stores will tell you it isn't a real problem, but it is.  Get a real micro-SIM.  I went to some Cricket store across town that had micro-SIM cards in stock, and still had to harass them into selling me a micro-SIM instead of one of their universal bring-your-own-phone kits.  Then I couldn't activate it through the Cricket website for some reason.  However, Cricket has awesome support by email through a tool called Zendesk, and they had me activated with my number ported from AT&T in around an hour.  Not sure what is happening with other carriers, but from what I understand, most of them are pushing these universal SIM kits with adapters.

If I had to make this purchase again, I probably would, unless I needed the phone quickly, which might be a problem with their back-order situation.  The other phone I would consider would be the new Nexus 5X, for $399, but faster and with a better camera, a fingerprint reader, and more timely updates and patches for Android.","4.0 out of 5 stars"

But I've used them, watched them and researched them. I held because of stubbornness and budget reasons. But I've got to say this is a great phone with a ton of bang for the buck. If you are money conscious and want a killer phone, check this one out. I'd call this a high, mid-range phone- if that makes sense. Only minor cons- battery is good, but not replaceable; camera is so-so; and screen is not HD or as good as the newer high range phones.

I love it so far, I've convinced my daughter to go this route too. She is a high school kid who is not status conscious and wants to use her limited funds for other things too. This is a step up from her hand-me-down Iphone 5 (except for camera, the Iphone 5 has a better camera. If Motorola can improve camera and improve screen quality a little in next year's iteration, and if the world was fair and just, they should kick cell phone sales butt.

On the outside it looks nice, and the camera is good, but it can't run basic features, the phone laggs and freezes nonstop on basic programs like google chrome. Apps crash nonstop, AND WHEN ANSWERING THE PHONE I LOSE HALF MY CALLS BECAUSE IT FREEZES WHEN YOU CLICK ANSWER AND IT HAS TO LOAD THE TELEPHONE SCREEN.50% of the time the when pressing the home button or apps button, it freezes and you have to shut the phone screen on and off 1-10 times to get I to work again. Plus the first time I dropped it I cracked it, with a heavy duty case, my galaxy 3 lasted 2 years with hundred of drops and 0 cracks.
And it's not just me, my brother bought this phone and has the same problems with the phone running basic phone features.

I don't have a great demand for the newest greatest phone on the market.  Texts, facebook, pictures.  That's about it.

Pros:  The battery life is unbelievable.  This is a true 24-hour phone.

Cons:  The very limited internal memory requires constant vigilance because it seems to constantly fill up.  To mitigate this, I inserted a 32Gb SD card and integrated it to be part of the phone's memory.  But the phone has daily errors of the card not being inserted, which causes daily memory problems.  These seem to kick in when I plug the phone into the charger.  It resolves itself with a restart, but it can be pretty inconvenient.  Various Motorola forums confirm that this is a common issue with this phone.

Next phone purchase, I'll probably get something a little more stable.  But again, that battery life makes up for a LOT of downside on this phone.","3.0 out of 5 stars"

Another con is that the only way to get to the battery is by removing the screen in front - something to consider if you plan on keeping this phone for more than a year or two.

I though about getting the original one again, but I did not much care for the camera or that I had limited memory. I looked at the new 3rd generation and I am once again so very happy with the purchase. After 12 hours I have 65% battery and the screen is better than the original and battery seems to last longer. The new camera is really nice and I put in a 16gb memory card and loaded all my music on it. Phone seems solid like the first and has a great matted back making it easier to hold. The phone is considerably bigger than the first generation, which is a little weird, but not a deal killer. The OS worked great on the 1st gen and now it seems to work better on this phone. It is butter smooth and multitasks without lag. Very impressed.

Pros: Bright, beautiful screen
Call quality is really nice
Speaker is loud and not tinny sounding
Really nice feel in the hand
Camera has improved significantly since gen 1
Even with only 1gb ram, runs really smooth
Flash storage is really nice
The phone antennae works as well as other motorola phones

Cons: No NFC

Really there is nothing to complain about because it costs less than $150. What an amazing deal for such a great phone.

First let me start out by saying the majority of my smart phone experience is mostly iOS and this is my 1st Android. So far I'm very impressed with the Moto G and at this price range I'd go as far as to say it's the best phone i've ever had. I went with the 16gb and 2 gigs of ram version and added my 64 gig SD card ( even though it says up to 32 in the description ) from my old phone for a total of 80gb of storage. If this were an iphone i would have had to pay $750 for the 32 gigs so having spent $220 for more than twice as much space this is truly a bargain.

The interface is smooth and snappy and the pure Android with little bloatware makes the whole experience smooth and seamless. In a lot of ways the UI on this cheap phone is better to me than on iphones. As I said before this is my 1st Android and I really enjoy all the customization options. Everything just feels more free.

I love the design and is very comfortable in the hands. The screen is just the right size for me and everything thing looks crisp and clear. The build is just the right weight as well, not too heavy or too light. I'm not too sure about the performance of the 8gb version but i highly recommend going for the 16 if you use a lot of apps like I do. Not for the storage which can always be upgraded but for the 2gb of ram. It makes a huge difference.","5.0 out of 5 stars"

I considered this purchase somewhat carefully and have a lot to say about it. I've only had the phone for a week, but I'm quite satisfied so far. It does all the things I need it to do, plus a few extras thrown in.

What I was looking for:

Price: $200 or less
Size: Must fit in hand
OS: Anything but Apple (price requirement probably excludes that anyway)
Features: WiFi and LTE capability, FM radio, average camera, removeable but decent battery, headphone jack, decent memory/processing and enough storage for some books, music and podcasts.

What I got:
All of those except the removeable battery, plus water resistance and a relatively crisp screen. I did have to buy an SD card to expand the storage from 8GB to 32BG, but I didn't mind that. I don't use a lot of apps, but if you do, you'll probably need more than 8GB.

I also like the quick access to the flashlight and camera. The first time I used the flashlight and camera, a pop-up informed me that I could access either with a chopping motion (flashlight) or twisty motion (camera) even when the phone is locked. I don't know how common that is on smartphones because this is my first one, but the little tutorial tips were easy to follow. The only drawback to this is that someone could take pictures with your locked phone. In order to view the pictures already on the phone, however, it has to be unlocked. This doesn't bother me personally, but could be an issue for some folks. I believe this feature can be disabled.

What I use it for:
Texting, getting email alerts so I don't have to be logged into my work and personal email AND near my computer to know I have an email, calendar reminders and general organization, alarm clock, Kindle replacement (I just can't read on my desktop), amateurish snapshots, Netflix, web browsing, viewing and editing work documents on Google (just quick, little things, not extended work), maps, flashlight.

What I do not use/need:
1) LTE. I don't have a data plan and don't intend to get one any time soon. I wanted the capability so I'd have that option, since I don't plan on buying a new phone until I absolutely HAVE to. I can't comment on how well the phone works for on-the-go data b/c I use it exclusively with wifi.

2) Camera. I mean, I use the camera, but I'm not any sort of judge of the quality. I've had trouble with blurry pictures, but I'm 99% certain that's user error. When I take my time, the pictures look good to me. Better than what I really need, in fact.

3) Navigation. Since I don't have a data plan, I only use it as a replacement for a physical map. I download maps ahead of time if I think I'll need them, but otherwise I don't use this function. I suspect the quality of the GPS would have more to do with the network than the phone anyhow.

4) Lots of processing power. I'm not a ""power user."" I have a desktop for that. When I'm out and about, I'm doing something else, so I don't have a lot of need for a lightening fast, top-of-the-line model. However, I have to say that for the price, this phone moves pretty fast. There's very little lag in the interface and most web pages and videos load without issue on wifi. The Imgur app runs pretty smoothly, even when viewing large albums. So does Google maps. For me, the phone goes above and beyond in that regard.

Other models I looked at:
BLU Studio Energy
Moto E
Samsung Galaxy Core Prime

Why I chose this model over those:
The Studio Energy's superpowered battery appealed to me, but when I tried one out at the store, it moved rather sluggishly. There were also some reports online of stability issues and defects. The volume and quality of some of those reports gave me pause.

The Samsung model seemed good on paper, but some reviews mentioned that the display and camera were subpar for the price. The price difference between the Moto E and Moto G was small considering the extra power the G has. And I liked the way the display on the G looked: very crisp and pretty visible in full sunlight if you turn the brightness all the way up. All in all, the Moto G just seemed like a better phone for the price. And everyone I know who has had a Motorola phone (including me) liked it and experienced few problems.

I'm sure there are other phones out there that would have served my needs, but so far this one is working out splendidly. It definitely doesn't feel like a budget phone. The only cons are the battery life and the fact that the battery is not removeable. Not that the battery drains THAT quickly; even with a few hours of listening to the radio and streaming video, it still lasts the whole day. But if you're going to use it a LOT, you'll need a battery pack or something. The fact that I can't remove/replace the battery bothers me, but again, the tradeoff is the water resistance. My previous (flip) phones sustained water damage just from being in my pocket when it was hot out (EVERYBODY SWEATS, OKAY?) or rained. According to one review I watched, the phone kept playing video when submerged in a glass of water. Though it should be noted that it is only water RESISTANT. Motorola doesn't claim that you can submerge it in liquid without damage. However, I do like that little bit of extra protection, since I want to be able to keep the phone for a while.

If I run into problems, I will update, but so far I'm very happy with this purchase. I feel like I got a lot (though obviously not all) of the benefits of joining everyone in the 21st century without paying the horrendous price tag that many people pay. ($800 for a phone? You could put together a reasonably decent gaming desktop for that. It's just not my bag.)","5.0 out of 5 stars"

The screen resolution is nothing to write home about but then again, the dimensions aren't overtly trying to be a phablet. The camera is decent for taking your average shots / selfies etc as well. The phone can get just a tad toasty but then again, what phone doesn't when multitasking. It's nothing to be concerned of however like the Sony Xperia. Battery life as well is pretty average. Several other reviews boast amazing charge times as well as the ability to hold a charge tremendously longer than any iPhone or samsung, but again, it all comes down to what type of apps you're running. Chances are, if you're considering buying this phone, you're not going to be doing heavy gaming or running CPU intensive programs. A final take-away, if you need an android phone, don't want to pay mid tier prices, value quality over looks and functionality, then definitely this is the best phone out there ATM. And hey, if you're the type of user that might jump in the shower, and realize you forgot to text your boss telling him you're running late, no need to wipe off your hands...haha!

I'm not sure if I should even call it a budget phone. Of course this isn't a premium flagship smart phone that would literally cost 3-4 times as much. The internal storage is one the low side. 8 GB in my case which nowadays fills up pretty quickly.There are also some performance hiccups now and then. But to be honest it performs pretty smooth most of the time. Camera is passable, but don't expect too much from it. Having said that the phone does what you need it to do. You can check your Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, web, email without any problems. The battery easily gets you through the day, maybe two days even. I think the device looks and feels good. You can change the backcover. It's waterproof. No software bloat. All and all this is a pretty good device. Motorola shows that budget phones nowadays can be really good.","4.0 out of 5 stars"

At first things were great, but within 2 months the storage limitations became a huge issue. Motorola left less than 5GB for apps and media. Many apps, such as Whatsapp cannot be moved into the SD card and so, even keeping just the basic apps, we can no longer install any apps or even upgrade existing apps due to lack of space.

To make things worse, the 32GB Sandisk class 10 card we bought for the phone keeps getting ""SD Card removed unexpectedly"" message, making the phone completely useless. Upon complaining to Motorola support, they came back stating that the 8GB model can only accept cards with speed of class 8 and less. This is not stated anywhere in the product specs.

Stay away from the 8GB model.

Update: I was able to make the Sandisk card class 10 work by reformatting it to FAT32 with allocation unit size of 15K instead of 32K so I added a star.

I still recommend purchasing the 16GB model and not the 8gb due to the app storage limitation, at least until all apps can work from the SD card.","3.0 out of 5 stars"

 - Radio, Motorola has been known to have awesome radios in their phones, and the Moto G picks up good signal everywhere I used it.
 - MicroSD, good luck getting a phone from Samsung or Apple if you like to save pics or music to an sd card
 - Customization, Moto has some sweet options if you're buying straight from them.
 - Front facing speaker
 - Size, it's a nice size and for a 5inch screen its comfortable to hold and manageable with one handed use as well.
 - UI, pure Android with Moto enhancements is just smooth as silk!

Cons:
 - Screen, It is pretty bright and a nice size but Moto should have tried to put in a 1080p display here
 - Camera, it's not bad. it uses the same sensor as the Nexus 6 but it's not winning any awards either.
 - Processor, Moto should have definitely used the snapdragon 615 instead of the 410. If you play a lot of games on your phone, you may want to look at other options.

Overall for $220, you get a lot of phone for the price! clean Android with fast UI and Android 6.0 coming soon, Moto G will sure see it before many other phones out there. Moto knocked it out of the park once again!","5.0 out of 5 stars"

- small-ish 5 inch screen is still fits in a jean pocket
- battery life is AMAZING, I'm able to go through a good 10 hour day (with messaging, navigation, game playing, web browsing here and there) without freaking out about my phone dying
- smooth interface, for the average user (i.e. me) I don't notice any lagging switching between apps or playing simple games or other tasks like voice commands and whatnot
- really nice front and back camera!
- Under 200 dollars!  Although I bought the 2gb RAM version which was 220 and totally still worth every penny
Cons (there's really only one):
- No LED light notification.  Switching from Samsung galaxy which has multicolor LED notification so I can tell if I have a message, email, or any other notifications from across the room.  With this phone I have to physically pick it up for the Moto Display to turn on to see if I had messages or emails, I cannot get it to activate with a handwave like I think it's supposed to.

All in all, solid phone for under 250 dollars. When it comes down to it, I'd pick battery life over LED notifications any day.","5.0 out of 5 stars"

My review will consist of pros and cons in comparison to the previous phone. If anyone thinks my cons are incorrect, do let me know how to fix these issues, as I just may not have figured them out yet:

PROS
1) Faster, more memory (2gb RAM, 16 GB space)
2) Flashlight feature
3) Better camera (13mp) and 5mp 'selfie' camera
4) Not pre-loaded with too many google apps
5) already updated to android 6.0

CONS
1) no LED notification light. In fact, display screen for notifications is just annoying, as it shows icons and you have to swipe to see your actual notification.
2) putting the phone on silent automatically puts the phone on 'do not disturb' mode so you don't get any notifications except for alarms. You have to swipe to see the rest of your notifications (ex- from apps) as they hide behind a black screen.
3) battery seems to run out a little quicker, though it does usually last a whole day.
4) screen is bigger (I prefer being able to hold a phone with one hand and this is slightly large), Not a con to other people, I know.","4.0 out of 5 stars"

I've had a 1st Gen. Moto G for about a year-and-a-half and been satisfied with it, so I figured the latest version would serve her well.  Plus, I figured, it would get her support for T-Mobile's new Band 12 LTE.  Except it turned out Lenovo/Motorola removed that support because they won't do what they have to do to get it certified.  So: A nice phone, but hobbled on T-Mobile.  It would get four stars, maybe even five, except for that.

I bought the Motorola G 3rd Gen. as it is consistently chosen as the best phone in its price range. I am happy as long as I can make calls, surf the web, listen to podcasts, and take the occasional picture. Brand, design, ultrafast performance, etc. aren't high priorities. Ultimately, however, I decided to return all three phones I received from Amazon and opted for the Nexus 5x, which is about double the price. The poor reliability of the Moto G isn't worth the savings. I recognize that some problems might be related to Android, T-mobile, or (very possibly) user error and not because of the hardware...but in some cases it was definitely the hardware.  In short:

- Originally ordered on Jan. 1, 2016. This phone worked but it would not read the SD card, even though I could format the SD card when I first installed it. The SD card is the same as the one offered on the Motorola site (SanDisk Ultra  microSD card 32G) so it should be compatible. The second problem is my bad in that I was using the iPhone earbuds initially and they worked with the phone with no problems. After a while, they stopped working but this is probably an Apple thing and nothing to do with Motorola. I had no problems after switching to a different pair of earbuds with a mic (but not after a failed experiment with the SoundPEATS QY8 Bluetooth 4.1 Wireless Sports Headphones, which are passable as earphones but pick up tons of background noise when talking on the phone).

- Ordered a replacement phone on Jan. 30. Long story short, SD card was fine but incoming calls went straight to voicemail and outgoing calls would connect but neither party could hear the other. It wasn't a problem with the SIM card as I did not have this problem with the original phone. Just in case, I got a new SIM card from T-mobile but still had the same problem.

- Just in case I was just really unlucky, I bought another Moto G on Feb 22.  Didn't work out of the box.

- My Nexus 5x just arrived today. We'll see how it goes.

- One saving grace is Amazon's service. Extremely quick to send replacements and painless return process. After reading about Motorola's awful customer service, I'm glad I didn't buy directly from them.","2.0 out of 5 stars"

At first, I bought the 8GB model and like it, then I decided to buy and try the 16GB and so glad that I did. This phone has truly surpassed my expectations!  This Moto G 3rd Generation Phone is just the right size, not too large or too small! For you the reader, my goal here is to give you every day and practical uses regarding this phone.

PROS:

+ SOUND QUALITY FOR PHONE CALLS and MUSIC ETC - This phone has LOUD SOUND QUALITY in speaking and listening is EXCELLENT with no distortion, much better loudness than my old Samsung Grand Prime! Even on speaker phone, the sound is plenty loud for me to hear and others hear me just fine. (I have slight hearing loss so I have to have a LOUD phone and I am so glad that I bought this phone, just one of the many reasons why I am very pleased with this phone).
**Also, the music plays plenty loud on the phone speaker.

+ Tethering....Normally I do not tether but to find out if the Moto G 3Rd Gen tethers well, I tried this and YES it works using the Moto G 3rd Gen. Well, I wanted you to know that this phone does have Tethering abilities (USB or Bluetooth, Hotspot). It works flawlessly for me. However, since I have a small data plan...usually do not tether yet I  tried to see if jt worked...it works great. I used the Bluetooth tethering and paired the Moto G with my Tab 3 8.0 (WiFi only tablet) FIRST. Then I Bluetooth tethered. Very fast.
You will need to check with your carrier and be sure that it is OK to tether on your Data Plan. For me, I am on WiFi 95 percent of time and no need for Data, so I only tried tethering to test this phone in that regard.

+ WiFi Connecting/Speed of WiFi - Very, very fast--in fact in the back of my home, I still get 4.5 bars of WiFi signal on this phone! This I tested using my home router and on the go at many hotspots with WiFi. . Other hotspots: No problems at all connecting and staying connected on these. And I found the speed still high at home with several devices connected to the router, no loss in speed. **Note that I had other phones before this one and for me, none gave me the quick connect and overall speed as this one!

+ Internet & Webpage & Video Viewing - The Chrome browser does a great job, however, I use Maxthon Browser with great internet viewing results and it renders webpages quite fast for me.

+ No lagging at all and no freezing, I have found this phone to very fast and responsive. This phone is a joy to use because of this!

+ Internal Memory and Storage Space – This is a plus and a minus, however, as for internal storage space (after I finished adding my personal apps in internal storage and updating today to the large 177.3 MB update), I still have 2.99 GB left and I added lots of apps such as Facebook, Twitter, Hangouts, Skype, Amazon Music, Amazon Shopping, Walmart and a large Office program, but I DID NOT ADD any games as most games take up too much internal space.
Internal Memory – To conserve my memory and add to my battery life, I downloaded the ES Task Manager (free) from the Playstore. It frees up my memory, and my battery is better and I am very pleased with the performance of this phone using this app.

  + Screen Resolution - VERY CLEAR! The colors are vivid and the fonts, icons are very clear. Even though this is a 5 inch screen, when I view pages on the internet, the text is clear and pictures very clear and colorful! For me, I can read everything well without my reading glasses.

+ Camera improvements/Performance (I am very impressed with this camera) – I had a Samsung Grand Prime with an 8mp camera and I took camera shots using both phones outside and inside. This Moto G’s camera produced much sharper and vivid pictures than my Samsung Grand Prime!
+ 13MP Camera – This camera I love, and I found that my pictures came out clearer and better when I did this:
-  I DO NOT USE the AUTO setting, just the flash or no flash and my pictures come out better now. My outdoor pictures I do not take in bright, bright sunlight, I take in shade and my pictures come out better. **Notes regarding the camera: I found that if I leave my flash either on or off (and do not set to AUTO), the pictures have come out so much better now (clearer with better color etc). I took some outdoor shots and indoor shots after this and found that my pictures really looked nice! Since I updated today the OS, I now have Nighttime Abilities on this camera (new).

+ Lollipop Pure Android Experience - Since this has close to pure Android with no overlays over it or bloat ware apps,  just the essential apps installed, this is a leaner phone that uses much less memory and battery than the ones that have those overlays and are not straight Android! This means that Lollipop OS runs better and faster than I expected.
**I have found NO LAGGING, NO FREEZING. For me, I have found this phone to be very peppy. Today, September 19, 2015, just received a stability update for Lollipop from Motorola. The update was large at 177.3MB.

+ EXTERNAL SLOT FOR MICRO SD CARD – My 32GB SD card works great. However, just to test this phone, I first added my San Disk 64GB Micro card that I had placed music on. My Samsung Galaxy Tabs (and Galaxy Prime) read it, however, this phone would read it but the 64 GB card would not work in this phone. Note that I found that my 32GB SD card stores plenty of my music on this and photos etc and still have over 6 megs left!

+ Data/WiFi Info -  For me, I do  not have LTE where I live but the data is VERY FAST, it opens webpages lightening fast!  I do not use that much data as I have WiFi at home and find FREE WiFi in most places that I frequent as Coffee Shops, Hotels, Library, Airport and more...
This very fast in WiFi at home or wherever I find Hot Spots. Also, when I have to turn on data in my car, the speed is very fast as well on this phone. I find it FASTER than my older Samsung Galaxy Grand Prime was!

+  Office Program with the phone - Found it to be OK, but I went to the Playstore and installed WPS Office (which lets me edit, save, view in MS Office types and also view PDF files). There is also a MS Office App (free) in the Playstore.

+ Music Player - This phone comes with Google Player installed and I like it OK. It does play music that is stored on my external SD card nicely and saves new Playlists OK (and Google Player also plays music from the Cloud). However, let me suggest RocketPlayer (free) from the Playstore. I like it because my music is on my external SD card and it plays it in playlists or from my folders etc. I have already created my playlists on it and the sound is superb!

+ Home Videos - The stock video player is OK and plays MOST home videos, however, may I suggest QQ Player (Free App from Playstore and the ONLY one I recommend as it plays every home video I tried).

+ Battery Life/and more…- Excellent and the best I have found yet! Since this phone does NOT come with lots of bloat ware and useless apps, this helps the memory to run better and the battery last longer! In fact, I have gotten a day and a half of battery use (I turn off WiFi when I am off the internet or email etc).  However, I run my brightness at 100%. So on an average day, I get at least a full day with about 15 percent left (sometimes more) and then I charge it overnight.
There have been some reports of people saying that this phone runs a bit warm/hot. Personally, my Moto phone runs about 85 degrees F to 97 degrees. It will go up to about 97 degrees when I take lots of pictures using my flash or if I download apps from Playstore, but it goes right down to about 85 degrees in no time. This is very normal because many of the newer phones these days with the larger and faster processors run warmer than older phones did in yesteryear with smaller processors.

+ Bluetooth Speed and Performance - The Bluetooth paired quickly with several devices and copied files at a great rate of speed.This is the fasted Bluetooth connection that I have ever used, easy to connect to every device (phone or tablet) or speakers, headsets etc!

+ OTG - The micro USB port on this phone is OTG (On the Go) compatible, this means that if you order a OTG Adapter Cable, then you can place a flash drive, USB Mouse and more into this phone. For me, I have been able to place my 32GB Flash drive in this adapter and easily copy files from this phone to my flash drive!

+ Very, Very Peppy and fast - The added memory of the 2GB really makes a HUGE difference. Found the response on this phone to be very peppy and fast, no lagging!

+ File Manager - I went to the Playstore and found Astro File Manager, it is easy to find my files on my SD External card and also on the phone. Liked it so much, I bought the AD FREE version!

MY PERSONAL BOTTOM LINE:  If you are trying to decide between the 8GB or the 16GB, I suggest that if all possible, you spend the extra 40 dollars and purchase the 16GB, plus 2 GB RAM. It is so worth every penny! After I install LOTS of apps. including Twitter, Facebook, Office and more, I still have about 10GB left for more apps if I want to install later on.

BOTTOM LINE FOR YOU...Should YOU consider purchasing this phone at 16 or 8?  1) Yes the 16 I suggest, if you are looking for a easy to use and reasonably priced Android smartphone that has wonderful battery life, let me suggest this phone to you.
2) Yes if plan on installing LOTS of apps. However, if are careful with the apps you install, then you may do OK with the 8GB however, after you install just a few apps, you will have 2 to 3 GB left or so and you will have to keep an eye on the apps...","5.0 out of 5 stars"

However, it is a giant at what it tries to do. It opens up the world of smartphones to those of us who want digital mobility, but can't or won't spend the money on a top-of-the-line device. It will give you some nice hardware at a budget price. The performance has been more than adequate and I am hooked on Android. I don't feel any inclination to upgrade to a more expensive phone. I would highly recommend it. If I had to find something negative to say about the phone, I wish it had more onboard storage than 8GB, but that's no deal breaker.","5.0 out of 5 stars"

Well, I'm here to tell you that not only will this device do the job, but it'll do it so well that you'll keep having to remind yourself how little you paid for it! I'm sure I don't need to sit here and list all the positives about the Moto G. Seriously, scroll up! Look at what you get for such a small investment! Need some water resistance? Excellent battery life? A phone that actually uses a microSD card (so few phones even give this as an option these days)? How about a 13MP camera, something you would never expect to find on a budget device? 5"" HD screen? You and I BOTH know that's the perfect screen size. If I wanted to carry around a tablet, I'd go buy a tablet! 5.5""+ screens? No thanks! Near stock Android without bloatware? Yep, you'll find that here, too. Oh, and let's not forget that it's one of the few phones to actually put the buttons on the correct side (in my honest opinion)! Pure convenience!

Last, and definitely not least, UPDATES. You can take solace in the fact that this phone will receive updates super quick for a long time to come (even the 1st generation Moto G has Lollipop), not just because of bloatless Android, but the Motorola name!

From a price/pros standpoint, this phone currently leads the pack in 2015! Trust me, you won't be disappointed!","5.0 out of 5 stars"

Motorola's Moto G series started and so far has been on the forefront of budget smartphone market which has now gotten so better & competitive that they've been dubbed ""Flagship killers"".
I can start to bog you down with all the techie jargon & technical specifications of this phone but it is unnecessary, leave those to the 5% nerds & geeks. It all bogs down to the overall day to day user experience the 95% typical phone users like me(and probably you) who just wants to get first and foremost, a clean software experience not filled with unnecessary OEM bloatware that I never use or need, nice & comfortable feel on the hand, reliable internet access, access to emails, access to social media(fb, Instagram, Whatsapp, tumblr...) , be able to listen/stream to my favorite radio stations & podcasts, get navigation information, weather updates, SMS(do people still use these??), Voice/VoIP/Video calls, the occasional selfie/group photo/random photo moments, listen/stream music from my playlists or favorite artists on Soundcloud/Spotify.... watch cat videos on youtube ;-) , organize my life and track important dates/events with calendar/notes, casual browsing or shopping on Amazon/ebay/bestbuy, play candy crush etc... Then this phone can do all that without a hiccup. No gimmicks, just pure day to day usability.

And the best feature in my opinion from Motorola with all their devices apart from the very competitive pricing, is the guarantee for timely(maybe not so much after Lenovo took over from Google) software updates. I bought the Moto G 1st gen back in 2013 when it was running Jellybean, I was able to upgrade it through over the air(OTA) to KitKat & handed it down to my little sister who now has upgraded it to Lollipop without a hustle, just purely OTA updates from the good people at Motorola themselves. I have a Moto G 2nd gen from 2014  and this Moto G 3rd gen from 2015 & I believe all(or at least the 2nd & 3rd gen) Moto Gs will get the Marshmallow update(I heard soak tests are already underway in select European and South American Markets) ISN'T THAT AMAZING!!!!!!! Motorola made a promise & they've been able to keep their word, maybe not as smooth & timely as planned but still, they kept their promise and I respect & admire them for that. We usually know that other OEMs only update their flagships(non flagships are left to be forgotten) in a usually messy and painstakingly long wait. Except google's own Nexus line of devices, It is unheard of in the android ecosystem(due to fragmentation) for OEMs to support 3year old devices through OS updates. Much Kudos to Motorola for changing that, other OEMs should follow Motorola's example, there is nothing worse than buying a 600$+ flagship android device(let alone a non flagship) that will be a dinosaur in the next 8months just because the OEM didn't provide an update of the latest Android OS version either because they see no financial value to doing so or they are struggling with the mostly unnecessary customization to the lousy skins they slap on stock android.

VERDICT: If you want a phone that is RELIABLE, has GOOD PERFORMANCE, has a REASONABLE PRICE and will be able to KEEP UP(software updates) with the android ecosystem for the next 2 or 3 years(maybe more...) then look no further, this is the best companion for you. Otherwise if you want a 1000$ phone to match your 2000$ bracelet or if you want a phone to power your hadron particle collider in your secret lab down your basement or if you want a phone to photograph distant stars and solar systems in the sky at night or if you want a phone to record 5hour 4K videos of your cat purring or if you want a phone to play the latest version of GTA/FIFA/Fallout/World of Warcraft/Halo/Assassins Creed/Tomb Raider/... in 4K at 10000FPS or if you want a phone with battery life to last you through the imminent zombie apocalypse... sorry, this is NOT the phone for you, please look elsewhere( I know a friend of mine who is crew in the Enterprise NX-01, he's been to places where they might have what you are looking for. He might be able to help...)","5.0 out of 5 stars"

"","","Believe it or not the phone is hard or impossible to answer.

The ui that presents itself is inconsistent. If the phone is unlocked, meaning you are past your pw screen, you either get a big blue screen which consumes the whole screen or a small - too small - little white dialog which has 2 choices : decline and accept.

If you hit this deline / accept dialog in the wrong spot ... which is itself ill-defined yet easy to do, then you lost your one chance to answer your phone, buster, so try harder next time.

 If you get Big Blue, which I can't emphasize enough is in no way related to the state of your phone, then you can hit it anywhere EXCEPT on the little phone icon in the middle because that ""means"" reject call....

When I said earlier that you lose the ability to answer the phone if you hit the decline / accept dialog wrong, I meant it. You cannot thereafter hit any button, real or virtual to answer the call, nor can you go into the phone application and hit any button... in fact, when your phone rings it is WRONG to hit your phone icon and go into the application at all...you cannot answer the phone via the phone app...

This is worse than an merely ordinary level of bad UI...it reeks of the effect of software patents.

One company patents a ui for answering the phone then another patents another way and soon all the natural, obvious ways to answer the phone are some corporation's private property which is their ""competitive advantage ""and the phone you buy has to live in the UI ghetto.... that's software patents at work for society.. creating a new class of non-contributing rentiers and UI ghettos instead of having a world with a shared commons of good ideas, like the first 50 years of software development gave us.

Here's to the degenerate coke-snorting lawyer class and the ""progress"" they bring society.. here's to the CAFC and other Ayn Rand freaks with their non-reality based, just-so fairy tales involving perfect markets populated by perfectly selfish consumers whose only concern is (because everyone is a sociopath in their theories) maximizing their personal profit ....  all those Platonic economic theories swirl around and around the ideosphere like a gigantic floating pile of ocean trash and what results is....I can't answer my phone.","1.0 out of 5 stars"

When it finally gasped its last, I did not hesitate to go for another Moto G. I love the look, the feel, the speed, the navigation, the sound quality. No complaints.

What really sealed it for me was this: on a recent family vacation, there were 3 IPhones, 2 Samsung Galaxys, 2 HTCs and a Blackberrry (I was shocked by the Blackberry, too, but  hey...). My phone was the only 'budget' phone, and my photos were the best of all, and the ones that we complied into the vacation album. Photo quality is amazing.

I am generally an iPhone user domestically, however when I travel I like having an unlocked GSM smartphone ready for me to connect to a local network directly. I previously used an LG phone to do that, but as a result of age and obsolescence, it was time to get something new. I chose the Moto G, and boy did I choose wrong. Because of the bloat not only of the Google apps on the phone (which is reasonable, after all it is an Android) but also several worthless Moto apps that don't have any clear purpose, the user is left with 4 GB of storage. One can expand this storage with an SD Card, such as this Samsung 32GB EVO Class 10 Micro SDHC Card with Adapter up to 48MB/s (MB-MP32DA/AM) which I did, but the ability to move photos over is very clunky and no applications can be stored on the SD card. Still this wasn't my real problem. My big issue was trying to get data from the SD card onto my Mac. I tried using the USB hookup and the Android File Transfer application from Google to no avail. I then noticed that I could push all the photos onto Drive, but in the process this seemed to be saving duplicates on the phone, overloading my hard drive, and killing the phone. While the phone still runs, I can only make outgoing calls and no one can call me inbound. It now seems next to worthless. I'm very disappointed and will not buy this product again and it makes me hesitant to reconsider Android as well.","1.0 out of 5 stars"

Pros:
+ nearly stock android
+ long battery life
+ sdcard storage, the new unicorn of features for smartphones
Cons:
- running more than a few apps causes it to slow down and even lock up
- when it freezes, it gets super hot (that was fun to write)

Perhaps my use case has me using too many applications or background services (two email clients, a music player, and a few web tabs), however I hoped that the Moto G would be powerful enough for that limited situation, slow downs I would expect, but I never though that I wouldn't need to buy hand warmers this fall.","2.0 out of 5 stars"

The speaker stops working unpredictably. This means, you suddenly cannot listen to voice/music through the speaker, and worse of all, you won't hear the phone ringing. Researching this on the web, I found this to be a common problem with moto g3. The build otherwise is solid, the look and feel is great, the pure android experience is the tops, android updates work without a hitch, all positives. Stuff that can be improved include the display quality, camera, and the music playback quality (may be there are apps that can do a better job playing back music, but the native playback is very weak). I'm mentioning this only to note that there are so many Chinese phones with much better specs on these. I guess you're trading off build quality and moto brand against better specs within this price range.

Because of the overall quality, I ended up returning this, but replaced it with the 16 gb model of the same. So far, the speaker has been working. Keeping the fingers crossed.","3.0 out of 5 stars"

When unboxing and flipping the phone over the first thing I noticed is the instructions on the back panel of the phone on how to properly remove the cover/reseal it in order to get the best water resistance. I also ordered a blue cover from Motorola directly which should arrive next week. While the back cover is removable the battery is not user replaceable - this may be a factor for some but I carry an external battery when travelling for work.

Moto G for my wife several years ago. She not only loved it, I found it to be very responsive and not prone to lock-ups like many of my previous Android phones. I later purchased a Moto X, which I liked very much - but managed to kill it in a pool only 4 months later (sadly, I had not purchased the insurance). I somewhat reluctantly purchased a Moto G 3rd gen for myself, and was very surprised how little performance difference there was between the X and the G (more of a feature-set difference, actually). I very much like the fact that the new Moto G is warranteed against immersion for up to 30 minutes (haven't put it to the test, but nice to know).

Mere weeks after I purchased mine, my wife ended up dropping her first Moto G in water (not warranteed against water damage), so she needed a new phone. Moto G 3rd gen for her! Fast forward 3 months, my daughter lost her phone (my old Nexus 4) somewhere in Arizona. We purchased yet another Moto G, 3rd gen - for her. So - all told:
• 1 1st Gen Moto G
• 3 3rd Gen Moto Gs

We could NOT be happier. I probably will never purchase another model until Moto/Lenovo discontinues it. This is my 6th Android phone, so it isn't as if I have no experience with them.

Before this I had a Huawei Prism II. That was a decent phone for my use. But this moto G is awesome. So fast and reactive. A beautiful design too! 5/5! Get one if you want a budget friendly smartphone!","5.0 out of 5 stars"

I like the slightly larger screen size. The camera resolution is now on par with rivals. No complaints thusfar. Excellent value at this price point.","5.0 out of 5 stars"

For an unlocked Android phone this is the one to get. The only minor complaint I have is the  stock camera app is not what I like. I like more control and features with my camera apps. Don't get me wrong it takes decent pictures as long as you have good lighting but it's just not my cup of tea. The phone has great sound quality, a good battery life and one of the best looking screens you will find for this price.","5.0 out of 5 stars"

I've had two now and both have the same issue, if you need to use a SIM tray adapter, there's a high likelihood you'll strip the contacts when removing the tray.  Motorla will charge you $60 for a repair, which I did pay once but wont do so again.  I have several other phones and have never had this issue once, I've had it here twice.  It's nice that this is a sub-200 phone but its not worth it if you have to pay a quarter of the cost to repair it.  Would definitely recommend you look elsewhere.","1.0 out of 5 stars"
