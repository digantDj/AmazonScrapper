Update:
I have recently put a 32 GB memory card in it and put my music on to the card. The first time I tried it I used the Microsoft music player it converted everything into wmp. Which is not supported by this phone. Then I went to the file where my iTunes stores my music on my computer and draged it onto my memory card and made sure it didn't convert it. Come to my surprise that all my music and my music videos now play on my phone. My music is mp4 if that helps anyways.","5.0 out of 5 stars"

The Honor 5X falls into the 'budget' category with 'mid-range' specs. For $199 USD it is a great deal. If you can live without the CONs below then this phone is right for you. Otherwise be prepared to spend another $100 - $150 USD.

PROs:

***Most of the specs it offers is similar to the iPhone 6s/6s Plus, One Plus X and Nexus 5X/6P***

Fingerprint scanner
Dual-SIM LTE slots AT&T, T-Mobile compatible
Snapdragon 615 Octa-core processor
16GB built-in storage
128GB microSDHC removable expandable storage
2GB of RAM
5.5-inch IPS LCD Corning Gorilla Glass screen
1920 x 1080p
13MP front 5MP back cameras
Aircraft-grade alumimium metal construction
FM Radio
3000 maH battery

CONs:

No NFC (No Android Pay?)
No WiFi Calling (this seems to be carrier specific)
No 5 GHz AC WiFi (only 802.11 BGN)
Older version of Android Lollipop 5.1.1 (through there have been news of proposed Marshmallow 6.0 update)
No USB Type C (stills uses microUSB therefore no fast-charging)
16GB built-in storage is so limited (but the 128GB expandable helps)

Final Comments:

Again for the price of $199 USD Huawei gives more than enough specs.
Many dislike the EMUI skin/launcher, but it does not bother me.
You can always install another skin/launcher.
TWRP 3.0 and Root is already available and installable.
Hopefully Custom ROMs will be out soon.
The Fingerprint scanner is very good and gives a faster response than the iPhone and HTC A9.
I have yet to test and see if it works in purchasing apps.
I will update the review as soon as I find out.","4.0 out of 5 stars"

This phone has been the talk of the town since it was announced. Once reviewers got it in hand, the hype got even stronger. For the Honor 5X the hype is real. The phone backs up it’s talk. For only $199 you’re getting an amazing experience.

Last year the budget phone that got everyone’s attention was the Moto G and rightly so. Motorola delivered a really great phone in the budget category. As a matter of fact, Motorola gave us their best yet with the G, Pure Edition, and Style. Those were phones you couldn’t wrong with. However, this year is already off to a great start and to be honest, the Honor 5X is going to be hard to beat.

There isn’t much not to like about the Honor 5X and with keeping the price tag of $199 in mind, the few complaints I have are minor.

What I Like

Build Quality – The metal form factor of the Honor 5X is what makes this device stand out so much. It feels like you’re holding a $500+ device in your hands, the same quality experienced with today’s top flagship phones such as the Galaxy S6, HTC One M9, Nexus 6P to name a few. Metal materials simply raises the quality of a device to the next level every time, making it a very smart move to make the Honor 5X with metal.

Being that the materials are made of metal might raise the question if the device is slippery or not. To me, it’s not slippery in most conditions. The Honor 5X is sized just right for handling the phone. Now if my hands are dry and cold it does increase the slipperiness, but even then because my hands are larger than average I am able to hold the phone without being concerned of dropping it. Not to mention I typically use a case with all my devices. If you like your devices naked, the Honor 5X will give you peace of mind it’s not going to slip out of your hands.

Fingerprint Sensor – This is a feature I want on every phone. I don’t care where the sensor is placed, as long as it’s present on the phone. Once you get used to using a fingerprint sensor to unlock your phone, you won’t want to use another devices without the feature. Much like the Honor 5X’s big brother, the Nexus 6P, the fingerprint sensor is placed on the back. For the most part the sensor is the same experience like the Nexus 6P. The sensor has a metal finish with a capacitive touch feel.

The sensor performs well and is very responsive. Personally, I like the sensor placed on the home button area, but I have also grown accustomed to locating the sensor on the back ever since I have used the Nexus 6P. When using other devices I tend to still reach for the sensor on the back. Kind of like the experience from the LG G3/G4 volume and power buttons being placed one the back. One of the benefits of the sensor being located on the back is when reaching in your pocket you can place your finger on the sensor while pulling out of your pocket and have the device’s home screen already opened up by the time you look at the screen.

Unlocking the phone and security isn’t where the fingerprint sensor features stop. There are a handful of gestures you can use with the fingerprint sensor!

Link with contacts to call with one gesture
Swipe down to view the Notification Drawer
Double tap to view Recent Apps
Launch apps
Snap pics
Answer calls
As you can see the Honor 5X takes the fingerprint sensor to the next level.

Screen Quality – The Honor 5X has a 5.5'  1080p FHD  IPS display and it looks good! Typically I am a fan of 2k+ displays because it’s now 2016 and if you’re putting anything less out these days you’re giving us old tech, but keeping in mind that the Honor 5X costs only $199 I am quick to forgive the 1080p screen. However, it’s easy to forgive because it actually looks really nice for only being 1080p. The Honor 5X is a prime example of the argument that you can’t really tell the difference between a 1080p screen and 2k screen.

Camera – The Honor 5X camera is very good! Usually if a camera gives me a bad experience I will not use the phone. The camera does not disappoint and I am happy with the results produced. Within the camera app are features like time lapse, shutter controls, button actions, slo-mo, focus options, and more. I’m confident this camera will produce the results I want out of a camera.

Follow the hashtag #Bane5X for some photo/video samples taken right from the Honor 5X without any editing, along with some Instagram posts.

Dual SIM Support – The Honor 5X comes with a dual SIM card support that also acts as a micro-sd card port. Port two can be used as a SIM card or sd card port. The 5X comes with 16GBs of internal storage, which these days is not that much after adding all your apps and HD pics/vids. I was pleased to see that I could expand my storage with this phone.

Developer Support – I’m not the average user. I like to tinker with my phones and discover ways to make it “better” than whatcha get out of the box. One of those ways is to install custom ROMs and mods. The developer support is strong with this one. Be on the lookout for many ROMs and mods coming out for this device. If you like to root and mod your phones, this is one you’re gonna want to get.

Price – Did I mention that the Honor 5X only costs $199? #NuffSaid. Well, let me add one more thing about the price. I asked three people who have never heard of the 5X and they all estimated the price to be above $550. They were shocked when I told them the price was actually only 200 bucks.

What I Don’t Like

UI – The UI needs some work. EMUI isn’t horrible, but it’s not great either. EMUI is like a hybrid between TouchWiz and LG’s UI. There are some cool features, but it just looks outdated. While I would prefer stock Android over EMUI, I still want features and that’s what EMUI does give though.

Availability – One of my biggest wishes for phones this year and onward is to have compatibility on all major networks. The Honor 5X is a GSM phone, meaning it will work with T-Mobile and AT&T. While those are good options for carriers to use, there are regions of the country that Verizon works best, such as the Southeast.

No NFC – Mobile payments is on the rise. Android Pay is doing everything it can to become a major way to pay for products/services. More companies are adopting mobile payments. Therefore, NFC is a must have feature.

Speakers – While this isn’t a deal breaker for me, I would like the sound quality to be a bit better. I’m not too picky on placement of the speakers, but they need to sound good. I would not recommend using the speakers as the main sound source for music or videos.

Button Placement – The power button is below the volume buttons. I am used to the opposite. Therefore, I find myself accidentally pressing the power button when I mean to press the volume rocker. Not a huge deal, but it’s annoying when I mean to press one button, but press something else.

Final Thoughts

As you can tell there are many pros about this phone along with a few cons. The cons are more so preferences than actual problems or issues. The Honor 5X is a well built phone and only sets you back a couple hundred bucks. If you’re using a GSM network you can’t go wrong with this phone. Heck, this phone could even make for a great media/streaming device.

The Honor 5X definitely set the bar for budget phones in 2016. I really don’t see any other companies giving us anything better than this guy.

First of all let me say, I did not buy this from amazon in effort to avoid the tax lol. Anyway, I absolutely love this phone! Fingerprint or passcode unlocking and so much more with that fingerprint feature! I can text MUCH better on this as compared to small phones. The camera is nice - at least I think so. Be sure to set things to go to the right memory in the phone AND the SD card. Another thing, be sure you have a good speed sd card - I think it says 10.0 or something of the sort. Mine was not at first and that can interfere with the phone's performance and speed.
Cons: It says dual sim and yes it's true but when you use a memory card (maybe it's me) I don't see how another sim can fit. I have two phone anyway, so it makes no difference. Just letting you know before you purchase to find out for yourselves. Also, if you lose the pin to open the sim card compartments, I hope you can find something else to stick in that little hole. Those are minor but my biggest issue why it only has nine stars is because it's a built-in battery. I know this seems to be the in thing now - but when the battery goes bad...I guess that means a new phone :(
Overall - I have no doubt the majority of you will love this phone as I do.

I'm a techie who put custom roms (like cyanogenmod) on his old android phones.  Not seeing a need to do that yet on the Honor 5X.  But is does need some configuration work to undo Hawei's unfortunate changes to Android.  This big thing is that the home screen (launcher) is heavily modified to look like iOS; If you are already to accustomed to regular Android, I highly suggest downloading a free launcher like Google Now Launcher or Nova Launcher.

Worst thing about it is they put the serial number sticker on the back of the phone and its hard to get off. Been a Moto G 1st and 2nd gen user for a while till I bought this and it blows them away. Not sure why people complain about the EMUI software, it's really not that bad. I think if they used it for a little while they wouldn't mind it. The factory screen protector is cool. Calls are crystal clear. I'm afraid my wife is gonna want one. I'd give it 5 stars but I'll have to use for 6 months or so to see if it holds up. See you in 6 months.

Everyone at the time said they never heard of Honor and that they would pass on it. Little did people know Honor is the phone made by Huawei and they happen to be in the top three cell phone companies after Apple and Samsung. They designed the Google Nexus 6P.

You can’t compare this phone to an Apple; Apple is a higher priced phone. I wanted to compare it to BLU but BLU is a lower end phone. It reminds me a lot of my LG G4, but the LG4 is more expensive. However, I have found I am using the Honor 5X more and it is my go to device lately. Out of the box, it feels solid in your hands. I love that it comes with a protector screen already on the phone because I am terrible at applying them. As far as cases, I ordered two and both cases were not sturdy enough to protect the phone. I am hoping with time more cases will become available. I have one of them on the phone but it does not offer much protection.

The fingerprint sign in is nice. However, I have noticed an issue with it. The first time I set it up it took for two days then stop reading my finger. After so many attempts, it locks you out for ten seconds and will ask you to try again. I then decided to change the fingerprint and it worked again for another two days. Now it seems it works, or it doesn’t. I am not sure why. If it does not read the fingerprint, it will ask for my passcode which is a backup. I am now finding myself using the number code since the fingerprint does not seem to work.

Battery life is amazing with this device! I have tried so hard to drain the battery on this and can’t. I spent nights installing several apps and watching movies and the battery was still charged. I haven’t drained the battery, and I have tried. The battery truly is amazing. I know some people do not like that you cannot remove the battery but that is not an issue for me. I have other devices I can’t remove the battery and accept that it is part of the phone.

I have installed Netflix, Pandora, Amazon Music, Alexa on it, they all work great. In order to get Amazon videos, you have to use the underground app and install it through the web on the device. Once I did that, I am now watching my Prime movies and other Amazon subscription with ease. This is the device I like to watch movies on. The picture is vibrant and the sound is great!

The camera has a lot of applications that the LG G4 has and also some of the newer iOS devices. You have the beauty part which will probably apply for to the ladies. You can add a beauty filter and the thinning of the face, blemish removal, you name it. It has a food setting which is nice for taking pictures if you cook. I love the camera and all of the settings. I have used it to record video and have been very impressed. I automatically back up all my photos to my Amazon Cloud drive as well.

This thing is fast as well. I have the latest Apple Touch and even though I did not want to compare it to an Apple device, the Honor is so much faster! I have not had it lock up on me or freeze.

This phone is truly amazing. I love it! I have been using it for weeks and am more impressed with it today than the day I first received it.","5.0 out of 5 stars"

Here's a quick list of my favorite features:

✤  It has a really sleek metal case with sort of rounded edges that give it a nice feel in the hand (if you use without a case, anyway).

✤ The screen is very sharp and bright and comparable to high-end phones.

✤ The fingerprint sensor works surprisingly well and opens the phone quickly.

✤ It has lots of card slots, which was a change from the iPhones I'm used to.  This means you can add memory and swap SIM cards in and out with ease.

✤ The phone itself is pretty fast -- not quite as fast as my iPhone 6, but still pretty fast.  Of course it runs Android and a lot depends on the programs/games you run, but this is no laggard.

✤ The camera is decent but not great.

✤  The battery life is great but it takes a long time to charge.

✤ In general, the workmanship and design seem very good, especially for this price point.

✤  Let me say it again: THE PRICE IS RIGHT!

In sum, I would highly recommend this as a very solid phone for a very competitive price -- perfect solution if you want near top-grade phone without the high price.  Good luck shopping!","5.0 out of 5 stars"

Not deal breaking by any means, at least not to me.

Pros:
1) Price
2) Fast and responsive Finger print scanner
3) sleek elegant look
4) expandable storage to 128 gb with SD card
5) 64 bit octa core cpu, 2 gb rm with a sleek 5.5 inch display
6) descent camera

Cons:
1) no gorilla glass, i noticed some minor scratches already even when I only wiped off finger prints with microfiber cloth.  I recommend using the OMOTON Tempered Glass Screen Protector, played games after applying it and it felt like it wasn't even there.
2) no Gyroscope / not compatible with google cardboard
3) battery is not removable
4) no fast charging.  approx 4 hours to fully charge.  Found that it shortens charging time dramatically if phone is put in ultra power plan (limited to phone and text only in this power plan)
5) average battery, when playing graphic intensive games on normal power, game still lags here and there.  gaming consume  0.76% power per minute on normal power.
6) EMUI interface isn't for everyone, but can easily be circumvented with a different android launcher.
7) no wireless charging option
8) speaker placement, your right hand will almost always cover the speakers when gaming.

Bottom Line: Will recommend phone to anyone who wants a descent and sleek phone but are on a budget and doesn't mind that there is no VR option (google cardboard).","5.0 out of 5 stars"

The performance is good enough for everyday use, but don't expect snapdragon 8xx kind of performance. The metal finish is really nice, looks very high end. However, there's a major flaw.

Pro:
- option to switch between standard and simplified UI, great for older people.
- fingerprint reader is very nice, very quick to scan and unlock, also support gestures.
- dual SIM and expandable memory slot, great combination.

Con:
- camera shutter sound is terrible, no way to change it
- average picture quality, but better than other phones at this price range
- slow charging speed

Major Flow:
- setting the main storage to be external storage (if applicable) will cause the phone very unstable.

Overall it's a great phone for the price. I think the storage flaw is a software issue, hopefully it'll be fixed soon. I'd recommend this phone to anyone who doesn't have $700 budget, it's on par with some $400 phones.","3.0 out of 5 stars"

The replacement phone that Amazon sent to me had a misalignment on this screen film from the factory and it had a bubble at the top. Amazon is sending me a 3rd phone.

I am a college student and am ALWAYS on my phone. Use for social media, snapchat, texting, email, web browsing, MUSIC, netflix, youtube. very little gaming, but sometimes clash of clans.  I was coming from an HTC ONE M7.  I have rooted all of my devices in the past but do not feel the need to root this device!

Design:  Metal body does not feel as metallic as my HTC did.  this metal feels a little more flimsy but MUCH BETTER than the plastic body you find on many phones like the samsung. Speaker on the bottom of phone is just fine. plenty loud and sounds pretty good even with volume up! Charging port has a nice click feel to it when you plug the usb cable into it. Same goes for the headphone jack. Only negative to the exterior design is the stock screen protector! this phone does not have gorilla glass or a special fingerprint reducing coating on it so a screen protector is a must! the stock screen protector however scratched in the first 24 hours of use.  I ordered a two-pack or tempered glass screen protectors off amazon for $8 to solve this issue 100%.

Screen: The 1080p screen is great! very visible outside and plenty bright in all situations. the resolution is plenty! you have to hold the phone super close to your face to make out any pixels and even then, it is almost impossible to find any pixels. I give the screen a 5/5.

Camera:  the camera is just so-so.  I give it a 3.5/5.  This camera will certainly get the job done and is acceptable in low light situations. The camera app that honor uses is great, has plenty of manual camera adjustments.  however when you use an app like snapchat the camera quality is not the best but is certainly acceptable!  The LED flash is SUPER bright! Whether you are taking a photo in the dark or using it as a flashlight the led flash is the brightest i have seen in any smartphone today!

Fingerprint:  I give this a 4.5/5.  it works great but takes about 48 hours of use to get used to placing your finger just right on the sensor to get it to recognize. but once you get used to it, it works great.. Unlocks the phone VERY fast!

Battery life: I am a very HEAVY user, i watch videos and brows the web constantly throughout the day.  I do not game however.  I have NO problem getting a full day out of my honor 5x.  Starting use at about 9AM and using my phone pretty regularly with the wifi and the bluetooth on all day i get to 9PM with about 15-10% charge.  And i am using the ""Normal"" (highest) performance level setting.

Charging: Others have complained about how long the phone takes to charge. I wonder if these people have not updated to the latest software or something.  Mine is taking about 2.5-3 hours to charge from 5% to 100%.  This is as fast as some other very high end phones but is plenty fast for me.

User Interface:  This is honestly my favorite part of the phone.  I am coming from both apple and android phones in the past. I have used cyanogenmod on my android phones (rooted).  I have not used the Honor launcher (EMUI3.1).  The first thing i did when i got this phone was download both Google Now Launcher and Nova Launcher.  However, without rooting there are certain software items you can not get rid of.  With samsung and HTC phone you are left with their terribly complicated and bloated software (calculators, weather app, notification menu, settings menu, and lock screens) .  I LOVE the EMUI weather app, phone dialer, notification menu, settings menu, lock screen, and notification drop down.  I am not going to root this phone because with just a new launcher this phone rocks!  very snappy and smooth interface and animations and transitions.

This phone is plenty powerful even though it only has 2gb or ram and an older snapdragon 616 processor.  It lasts all day and does not get hot, even under heavy use.  Feels great in the hand! has not lagged or bogged down on me yet even though i use this thing for all kinds of tasks throughout the day.  I am VERY pleased and recommend this phone to everyone i know looking for a new phone. please change out the stock screen protector with a tempered glass one!  Im using this on AT&T and am getting very fast speeds and call quality in the carolinas.","5.0 out of 5 stars"

I originally wanted the Nexus 6p but wasn't prepared to pay $500 for it. In searching for a more affordable option, I came across the Honor 5X and after reading reviews decided to go for it. Sooo glad I did. The main thing I'd like to point out is that it is very user friendly. Also there are lots of little small details that I've never had a phone do before, like letting me know which programs are silently running in the background consuming memory and giving me the option to close them. Fantastic. Feels good in the hand, not too big or bulky at all. It's a great smart phone, super sexy, easy to use. It has great storage with 16gb, but you get more like 10gb in reality. I ordered the Sandisk 64gb Extreme microsd card for it just so I could happily wild out with music and pics and not have to think about it. I am very happy with this purchase, and I'm pretty confident that you will be too. A little tip, when ordering a phone cover take care because the first one I ordered from Headcase Designs not only covered the fingerprint scanner, it was too short to get on the phone at all. Ended up ordering the gold with black Aomax Armor Dual Bumper Slim Fit Silicone Case. Fit like a dream. Very happy.","5.0 out of 5 stars"

The 5.5 size is not too big and the screen is just right for someone like me who wears glasses which why i chose it. I gave it 4 stars because i've noticed a few issues. I've had this phone for about 3 weeks and it worked well until a few days ago when I noticed the volume on messages and incoming calls wouldn't turn off. It stayed like that for 2 days and is working again. Then sometimes it would automatically answer when someone calls even though its locked and i have to use a password or my finger to unlock it. It's usually on silent mode so i won't hear it ring but it will answer for itself and the person who calls will hear everything on my end but i'm unaware of the call. Finger print scanner is amazing thus far.

Coming from a starter smartphone LG L70 two years ago, this recently launched in the US phone by Huawei sounded too good to be true! After much research, I ordered the Honor 5x in dark grey ( which looks black to me) has exceeded my expectations. Love the lightning fast fingerprint scanner that unlocks the phone, the beautiful and vibrant HD screen, expandable sd card storage (and yes, downloaded apps can be put on the sd card) and metal exterior. My husband was jealous of my new phone, so he purchased the Honor 5x in gold. My 12 year old granddaughter who was absolutely fixated on getting an iPhone 6s that cost $650.00 was amazed with the fingerprint scanner and high end features of the Honor 5x. She also loved the iPhone looking skin that Huawei put on it and she also ordered the Honor 5x in gold, which is very attractive looking. We are ordinary people who do not see a need to spend a lot of money to satisfy our basic cell phone needs. This phone with it's ""budget price"" fit all of our needs and many of our ""wants""!  If you are in the market for a mid range priced upgrade, I suggest that you get this phone before the price goes up!  The honor 5x is only available in the US from Amazon and Newegg and launched 8 weeks ago. With the amount of reviews, it looks like they are selling quite vigorously.

I plan to update this review with my granddaughter's teenage review after she gets her honor 5x.

 PS To get the sim card and sd card trays open, just put the included pin tool in the hole and push inward. The draw will pop slightly open and is removable. Instructions were not very clear on that. I have also used a small paper clip, so don't worry about losing the pin tool.","5.0 out of 5 stars"

Camera: The camera quality is mediocre at best. Pictures tend to have poor contrast and are over-sharpened. HOWEVER! The camera is very, very quick. It focuses very fast, and takes a picture almost instantly. This is a redeeming aspect of the camera, as most phones, especially cheap phones, have a camera that is exceptionally slow.
Build quality: Build is very solid. The metal back feels nice in the hand, and it feels very sturdy.
Fingerprint sensor: The fingerprint sensor is phenomenal, it is very quick and works at any angle.
Battery: Battery life is very good. I am not a heavy user, but I easily have 60% battery left at the end of the day.
Performance: Performance is good, but not noteworthy. By default, it has a ""battery saver"" mode enabled, which makes it very slow and laggy (this is probably the reason why some of the reviews say it is laggy). Disabling it improves performance, and makes the phone very smooth. Games that aren't 3d run well.

To top it off, the phone has dual sim slots + micro SD, which is something even the latest flagship phones seem to be leaving out.","5.0 out of 5 stars"

If I have to choose, the cameras may be on the top, then the battery, then the build, the quality, the performance, EMUI and user-friendly designs. All of them are really close on my ranking, and all of them should be above the average of phones in the similar price range in my personal view of point. The detailed review follows, and it is written for a review contest on Huawei's official club site.

<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<The nice cameras:>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
Given by one of the most complete comparison that I can found just before the release of the Honor 5X, this phone's camera is surprisingly among those of the pricy ones. One brief comparison of phone cameras by the PC Advisor website gives a summary table showing the main specs of most recent phone’s cameras. From the PC advisor's review as well as other review sources, there are only a few phones having a main camera resolution better than 13Mp that the Honor 5X phone has. These include Sony Xperia Z5 (23Mp), Motorola Moto X Force (21Mp), HTC One M9(20Mp), Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge+ (16Mp) and LG G4 (16Mp), most of which are way pricy than the Honor 5X. Other commonly well-known big names have worse camera resolutions. For example, iPhone 6S and 6S plus (12Mp), Google Nexus 6P (12.3Mp), One Plus 2 (13Mp). Most phones have a Video max resolution of 4K2160p@30fps as this phone does. The front cameras do not make a big difference (ranging from 5-8Mp over phones) and possibly we don't need a very high-resolution one. There are also some subtle differences of cameras on Opitcal stabilisation and LED flashes, which don't make much difference from this phone. From the parameters on paper, the Honor 5X phones have decent cameras among those fancy latest phones. Recent news show that Huawei is pairing with Leica--a famous German optics company--to make the best of phone cameras. I think Huawei really pays attention to the cameras in their designs.

How about the real feeling about the phone cameras used in daily scenarios? I have used the phone cameras in big conference rooms, a typical US class room, on street and many other places in my daily life. The cameras work great! Below I will give a few examples of photos this phone took...

One photo was taken from a large conference ball room (I was in the last row) is below. The screen is still recognizable. (See attached)
If I zoom in on the camera, for one example, the text on the screen is relative clear! (not available here, but in the original review for a copyright issue.)
In the classroom, this if very helpful to take a Panorama on the blackboard. I did one on a long and dirty blackboard for example below--the resolution is set to be relatively low and my hands were shaking at the end. The text is good enough for notes taking! (see attached).
This one is taken on street at lunch time. Please appreciate that the sun is right on the top of the top-right corner. The camera readjusted the light automatically so that you don't feel too bright, but I did! (see attached).

Not only the hardware, there are useful features and apps using the cameras. You can make photos in Valencia, Sweat, Sentimental and other flavors and beautify them in real time. It also has the dedicated design for taking photos for colorful and tasty food. Most interestingly, there are pre-installed apps for using the phone as a mirror, magnifier and flashlight if you need.  I always want to see the back of my head, but I couldn't do it until I have the phone. I just use the Mirror function and put the phone on the other side of my head and touch the screen to have a snapshot over the front camera, and then I can see if there is any grey hair on the back side in real details! The Mirror function is different than a normal camera because normal camera function may automatically re-focus for a fixed effect, but with the Mirror, you can zoom in and fix the focus if you want to see more details of the photo. Moreover, if you blow over the microphone, the Mirror really ""condensate fog""! Try it!

<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<The long-lasting battery and energy-efficient design:>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

I have tested the energy consuming and battery lasting time in a normal usage mode, a heavy usage mode and standby mode. All gives impressive results. With a normal use (wifi, camera on, Twitter and so on) in a conference event from 7:30am to 9:30pm, the phone still has 72% battery left over in the end. I have also tried a little bit of crazy, with wifi on for facebook, twitter, and sharing photos, no apps close if openned, uisng Endomondo to track my travel path using GPS and using a lot of apps, for the worst and heaviest usage, I still has almost 20%-30% of battery left after a day. Basically I don't worry about the power in a day for most of using cases.

For the standby modes, I tested two modes. One is with Wifi and GPS on (no SIM card installed over the course), the battery went from 51% at 9:34 on Feb 15 in the morning and to 44% at 6:19pm the same day with no a few automatic app updates. Only 7% of power drop in 9 hours. The other mode is just to have every app closed, no wifi and GPS, turned on for about 5 days. It still have about 90% of power left over in the end of test. However, I forgot to turn three apps off during the process, but it doesn't matter that much. See the picture below, it predicted there could be 30 more days alive time in the same mode based on the linear regression of past 5-day usage pattern.

I have tried to charge the phone using the wall plug and usb connector. Using the wall plug, 30min should give a decent of amount of battery power. 1 hour will make to ~50% of charge. Almost exact 3 hours of charge, the battery went to 100% from 0%. The USB charger on my Thinkpad X200 computer is very slow, I would say. It takes 5-9 hours to charge it fully. I cannot give you the exact number, because every time I charge it on my computer, I alway want to try out some new apps on the phone as it is really sticky :)

<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<Shining metal body and strong-built cores:>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

If you have the phone at hand, you won't refuse the light but solid and quality feeling. Huawei has really put a lot of efforts on building metals bodies of phones -- see the premium Mate and P series of Huawei phones as well. This quality build makes me feel this is a premium phone, seriously. In practice, I have put this phone in my pocket with a chain of keys for a week at least for testing. I can see there are some slight scratches on the screen side on the pre-installed (yes, you save the money) screen protector, but no scratching can be found on the metal back.

On the hardware side, the memory is basically enough for my tested usage pattern. The CPU & GPU are snappy for the current market as well. It is definitely faster than my Samsung Galaxy 4 phone purchased a couple of years ago. I did experience any detectable lag on most apps in the past two weeks. I have tried to compare the performance with a Nexus 5X phone from one of my friends. Both phone lags for almost the same of time on big apps. They just seem identical performance-wise. Besides, this phone has a good thermal dispersion design so that it only feels a little warm when apps are heavily running, yet stays cool in most of my using cases.

<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<Fresh-feeling EMUI and user-friendly design: >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

It has been convenient for me to directly use the fringerprint reader, pre-installed apps and swiping around over the phone on the EMUI Android system.

The first thing I want to hightlight is the fingerprint reader that most of smartphones haven't adapted to. To turn on the screen, you just need to touch the fingerprint reader on the back, it is fast and robust in most cases -- definitely faster than inputting the password by hand. But if you have sweaty hands, you may not be able to benefit enough from this function.

The EMUI and pre-installed apps are really convenient for me. Despite the phone screen is large, it comes with a one-hand design for me to input text and so on. Compared with some Samsung, OnePlus and some other phones, some of the apps are sorted out in a few separated draws, like Google Apps, Tools, Top Apps and so on, rather than a big Application folder. I feel this is a better design after switching from Samsung for several years of usage. I found the pre-installed apps are well considered and can cover web apps, radio, music player, movie player and most of daily usages. I installed Twitter, OneNote, Endomondo and a few others to make it perfect. The power saving features and the free Huawei backup storage offer are really a nice support for using the phone. I have been using the Huawei Swype input method for typing, I don't feel there is any different with other smart swype input method.

There are some useful settings as well. For example, on Accessibility, you can choose Gloves mode, so that the phone can respond correctly if you wear a glove and need to touch the phone in an unusual way. On the motion control setting, you can set Flip to Mute, Shake to Rearrange icons, Double Tap to Turn on the Screen, and Draw various Letters on the turned-off Screen to Turn on Flashlight, Music, Dialer and other functions easily. These designs are similar to OnePlus phones.

In sum, the UI is great; pre-installed apps and settings are really thoughtfully selected. You know what? The best thing is Huawei provides ROM instructions over the club website, which means if you don't like the EMUI, you can switch to other UIs with their supports as well.

Overall, I think this phone is built with almost the best hardware and quality with truncations of investiments on NFC, gyroscopic sensor and storage space. You can purchase a NFC card and up to 128GB SD card to extend the storage space if you really need. I don't feel the gyroscopic sensor is that important for now. One thing I need to remind you is that this phone comes with dual SIM cards support but does not come with dual wifi bands support. If you need to use two wifi receivers to enhance the wifi signal, this is a threshold. For my case, I have downloaded a 2.7GB upgrade package from Huawei over wifi in ~20min at a university, I don't think I need that enhancement of signal reception in my working environment. So far, I haven't found any other phone which has similar build and price at the same time in the US market.

BTW, the HiHonor community by Huawei is really great! I have got helps from the forum and the developers of Huawei in US really check the posts online for the future upgrade packages of the phone!","5.0 out of 5 stars"

Believe me, it is a hard decision. I mean, at the $200 price range, Honor 5X is a nice phone. The pros: good screen, metal body, and the most impressing thing about the phone, the fingerprint sensor. Some reviews mentioned about the EMUI, the customed andriod system. I am OK with the iOS -look of the EMUI. The cons, the camera is not really quick and sharp as it is described and after I only installed only one app, there was only about 10GB internal storage left and I got hiccups when switch between the apps. I know the Honor 5X is not a fancy flagship machine, but I do expect that it runs smoothly since I don't put a heavy load on it. I don't know it is the hardware or the software. And the biggest letdown is that dual sim feature because I do intent to use this feature. The problem is that only the 4G sim card can get a decent signal while another 2G card get weak and unstable signal reception. In my test, I get two sim card from the same carrier and the one on 2G mode constantly gets zero bars. I called the Honor support, one guy told me they did not hear such complaints and I might just get a lemon one and I should do an exchange. So, that is my experience with Honor 5X. In a summary, if you are not a heavy user for phone camera and you don't care dual sim, you should like the Honor 5X. Besides, the fingerprint sensor is really working very well.","3.0 out of 5 stars"

Two weeks daily use observations:

---The battery life is unbelievable.  Super-fantastic and phenomenal even.  Really, it's just unreal.  I can go 2-3 days between charges with normal usage.  I've had it on for 32 hours now and it's at 63%.
---I really like the power management in this phone.  The phone doesn't want anything sucking up juice in the background and it lets you know what's happening right in the pull down notifications.  It says ""Hey knucklehead, you left Angry Birds running in the background"" (kill button).  It's actually nicer than that.  It doesn't call you names but it does constantly make you aware of things you may want to turn off.  I love that.
---The included one-touch tool for cleaning your useless data from the phone internal memory and SD card is also quite nice.
---The GPS response is really fast.  I have other devices that take as long as a minute or more to lock on, I have some that are pretty quick (a second or two).  The Honor is as fast or faster than anything I've used.  The accuracy seem pretty solid too.
---Set up the fingerprint scanner.  It's awesome!  (I didn't for over a week)  Opening up specific apps with a certain finger from sleep mode is actually a useful feature that I may have a hard time going without in the future.  I have to keep the phone locked to use this feature (I wish that were optional) but I use code 0000 (simple) and both index fingerprints open it in under a second.  One finger opens music, another, my fav GPS app, etc.
---I like the included FM receiver.  You need to plug in earbuds or a 3.5mm cord as an antennae and the reception is really good.  What's also nice is you can swap between listening with the earbuds or using the external speaker.
---The more I play with it, the more I like the EMUI interface.  I refused to add a ""more android"" loader (yet?) as I wanted to give the vanilla interface a real test first.  Having no app drawer doesn't really bother me (who knew?).
---So far I am liking this camera.  It focuses very well and pictures have been coming out quite nice.  I've seen others do better in low lighting but overall, it's a good camera.  The perfect selfie makes me look 20 years younger if set to ""10"".
---The screen is really vibrant.  It has whites that are actually white and fairly deep blacks.
---On a more Android related note, I hear that there's already a working TWRP for this phone and they are working on a version of Cyanogenmod for it.  (My favorite rom)
---I took off the included plastic screen protector immediately (hate those ugly, peeling things) and added a tempered glass screen.  Tempered glass feels great on here, possibly more responsive!(?)

FYI - I hooked mine up to the $30/month, 4GB data, GoSmart Mobile plan in Seattle area.  Data seems fine to me but I don't use a huge amount.

Cons:
---Not Gorilla Glass (will always need a protector or micro scratches will develop quickly)
---Lack of cases available (only a handful of styles when I purchased).  It's new, and I suspect more cases will come if we keep buying this phone.
---It isn't playing well with my smartwatch (Moto 360, 1st Gen).  I can't seem to get weather pushed onto it and some other annoyances (worked perfect with my Galaxy S3).  Will keep trying.  I'll find a different watch before I dump this phone.  :-D
---I don't personally like the placement of the power button below the volume.  It's too low and feels awkward to reach with an index finger (the finger Samsung has trained me to use).  The fingerprint unlock circumvents this particular annoyance.

There's very few phones that match what this is at this price point.  The Asus Zen Phone 2 is nice too at a similar price, but the little extras here were hard to pass up.  I'd buy this again without hesitation.

I'm going to continue to carry it because it fits comfortably in a watch pocket and makes and receives phone calls.  Usually that's all I need or want, and usually I don't want to carry something as bulky as a smartphone.  Also, my flip phone's plan has no data, and it is VERY cheap, so I don't want to change.

Sometimes I want to take a picture, get an airline boarding pass, or use my bank's mobile deposit.  My trusty flip phone can't do those things.  The Huawei phone can.  I bought it because it can also act as a WiFi hotspot and has two SIM trays.  I opened a Ting account with Ting GSM SIM card - No contract, Universal SIM, Nationwide coverage, Only pay for what you use so I could have data as well as voice and put the Ting SIM in the tray that also holds the SD card.  I can move the SIM from my trusty flip phone to the other SIM tray should I ever want to carry only one device.

I don't have much experience with the Honor 5X yet, So far, I've made a bank deposit, checked Delta, and read a book.  Everything works just like you'd expect.  This is going to be as useful to me as a smartphone that costs four times as much!

Why four stars instead of five?  Huawei chose to modify the stock Android user interface, so things aren't exactly the same as my Nexus 7 tablet, and (so far) it's running Android 5.x (Lollipop) instead of the current Android 6 Marshmallow.  I could probably root it and make it run Marshmallow, but it seems there's a lot to go wrong for not a lot of benefit.  If only Huawei had stuck to Vanilla. {grin}","4.0 out of 5 stars"

The telephone arrived on time. I do like the minimal glitz box. A simple box to contain the telephone. I have spent the best part of today trying to use the telephone just to play music. This is definitely not iTunes & iPhone. Getting music to the telephone is labor intensive and time consuming. I never did figure out how to transfer my playlists to the telephone. I have them exported from iTunes and loaded them on to a 16GB MicroSDcard. Android does not find the playlists. I used the m3u format. I do find it annoying that the telephone lists all the songs in alphabetical order and not the original play order. Setting up openvpn is far more complicated than with the iPhone. Given my experience with the Android telephone so far i would purchase an Apple IPhone 6 before purchasing a sim card for this Android telephone. I feel like i am having to fight with the operating system to accomplish what i want. Given the maturity of Android the complete lack of seamless interfacing with iTunes is a major negative against the telephone. I have learned what i was hoping to learn when i purchased this android telephone. Android telephones are not my cup of tea. I will gladly pay much more for an unlocked iPhone 6 for the smooth interaction with iOS and iTunes. Having the ""home"" button on the back of the telephone is a negative.  I keep looking for it on the front.
The screen size is a good size. The music i was able to play did not sound as good as when played on an iPhone. That is no surprise given that iTunes and iPhone are seamless in operation. I cannot speak about telephone service at all. I will not be activating this telephone for cellular use. I am not sure what i shall do with it. I can use it for a camera, e-mail & the web. I will wait and purchase a refurbished apple iphone to replace my aging iPhone 4.","1.0 out of 5 stars"

I currently use a Nokia Lumia 1020, which runs Windows Phone 8.1. It has a 41 megapixel camera and a 4.7"" 720p OLED display. My wife currently uses an iPhone 6 and likes it quite a bit. She previously used a Samsung Galaxy S4 and was not a big fan, primarily due to bloatware and unreliable camera performance. I use a Sony Xperia Z android tablet with some regularity, while my wife has a Amazon Kindle Fire tablet for reading and browsing. All of this should suffice to say I've been around the block with respect to phones and operating systems.

So, the Huawei Honor 5X. This phone's internals include 2gb of RAM, 16gb of internal storage (expandable with 128gb SD card), a 4-core Snapdragon 615 CPU, a 5.5"" 1080p IPS LCD screen, a 13 megapixel camera with a dual-LED flash, a rear fingerprint sensor, and runs Android 5.1.1 Lollipop out of the box.

Overall, I was quite impressed with this phone for the price. Here is my breakdown.

DISPLAY

The 5.5"" IPS LCD display is every bit the equal of the iPhone. It is quite sharp and seemed to give every bit of the detail of 1080p, with good solid black levels (not quite to the depth of OLED) and good daylight visibility. I was especially pleased with the oleophobic coating that seems to have been applied at the factory (as a sticker). This made the touchscreen a joy to use and I almost never had to wipe it off. Bringing the phone to the ear did leave some smudges, but not as bad as some phones. The display is set by default to auto-dim in response to the environment, and I found this performance to be mostly good, perhaps just a bit slow on the uptake for brightening back up. My only real complaint is that, perhaps due to the combination of screen size (rather large) and thin side bezels, I had unwanted touch inputs from the side of my palm more than I would have liked. It only happened a few times, but it took me out of what I was doing once or twice.

AUDIO

The main speaker is on the bottom end of the phone. It did get appreciably loud, but became distorted above about 80% of max volume. Perfectly sufficient for some casual Netflix watching, but if you listen to music you will want to use a nice set of earbuds or headphones (not included).

PERFORMANCE

I was really pleased by the performance of Android Lollipop on this phone, which has ""mid-range"" internals. I never felt any lags or stutters, except perhaps when receiving a notification. The main apps I tested were Netflix, Threes, Dots, Facebook, MSN News, Wikipedia, the Google Play Store, and Amazon's ""Underground"" (?) store. Now, these are not incredibly demanding apps to be sure, but each was buttery smooth. They all loaded very snappily (the slowest being Threes), scrolling was completely smooth, and switching between apps was instantaneous. There was no problem with memory management - there always seemed to be about 1gb of RAM free at any given time. The chassis did get rather warm while playing Threes, but not really anything above ""slight"" for all the other apps tested.

CAMERA

The Honor 5X possesses what I would term an average smartphone camera for 2016. Yes, I am spoiled by the Lumia 1020, which still wins most internet shootouts despite being a 2013 phone. The Honor 5X runs Android's stock camera interface and has no dedicated shutter button (something I miss coming from a Lumia). Detail is good but not great, and zooming is hard-limited to about 2X. The flash performance is typical for an LED - a bit too bright close-up, not sufficient for far shots. It should only be used in a pinch. In daylight shots, the Honor 5X turns in a performance that is about the equal of the iPhone, to my eyes. It's not going to fool anyone into thinking it was taken with a DSLR (like the Lumia 1020 sometimes can), but you won't embarrass yourself on social media, either.

I have included two snaps - the first is the Honor 5X, indoors, with flash. Notice how blown out the LED flash makes the clock's glass, the contrast on the speaker grille, and the wood grain. The second pic is from my Lumia 1020 with Xenon flash. Detail, contrast, and color are all superior to my eye, especially in the above-mentioned areas. But with this said, I think this is a pretty average performance in today's market, and it's certainly competent for sharing.

BUILD QUALITY

You will be forgiven for thinking this phone is a clone of the HTC One line of phones from the rear. It is virtually identical. The aluminum chassis is pleasant to the touch and has all the requisite openings for antenna pass-through. The speaker holes on the bottom are symmetrical a la the iPhone 6. I did find the use of a serial number sticker on the back in between the camera and the fingerprint sensor to be a bit ugly. The body does not creak or bend with normal use or pressure. There are two SIM slots on the side that open with your typical SIM key.

Speaking of the fingerprint sensor, it does the job, and will turn the phone on within about half a second. I will say though that it failed to read on the first try about 10-20% of the time. This is not as good as the iPhone's iteration of the fingerprint sensor. Battery life seems quite good. The 3000 mAh battery is more than enough to power the mid-range internals for an entire day, probably a day and a half of moderate use. The Micro-USB port at the bottom (sorry, no USB-C) is quite clicky and firm. Speaking of clicky and firm, the volume rocker and power button are definitely these.

CONCLUSION

All in all, this is a pretty solid Android phone for 2016, that ticks a lot of boxes and does them all pretty well. Every feature of this phone is at or above the mean for today's market. I would have given it 4 stars, except for one huge factor - the price. At under 200 smackers, this is a whale of a deal. You're getting almost all of the performance of one of Samsung's higher end wallet-busters, but without the bloatware or the red-hot Snapdragon 810 internals, that eat battery like nobody's business. This phone competes very favorably with Motorola's popular Moto G line, which really sort of created this price segment. Huawei is making an aggressive play for the mid-range by including a few standout features like 1080p and fingerprint sensing.

I would not hesitate to recommend this phone to anyone shopping in this price range for an android phone, and I would even suggest a good long look at it for people who usually aim for the higher-end. If and when my Lumia 1020 goes the way of the dodo, I would not have any problem switching up, though I would miss a higher-end camera.","5.0 out of 5 stars"

I wanted an off contract holdover phone until IPhone 7 or 8.  I also like to have a decent Android phone, but don't need a Flagship.  The camera works well, but perhaps is not as high of quality as a decent Flagship.  It is suitable for most purposes.  The Huawei user interface isn't terrible, but there are advantages and disadvantages versus stock Android.  There could be more control over what files and apps stored on SD, which is hopefully resolved with Marshmallow update.  I just updated EMUI interface update yesterday.  The phone could use more internal storage in US version.  Exceptional deal for the price.  I really like the fingerprint scanner, which works very well and much more convenient to lock and unlock phone than password after initial boot.  The design of phone looks great, like a $600 phone.  The construction is solid.  One complaint is the touchscreen sometimes is finicky if used to Apple products.  The phone is slowed down my EMUI and octocore should seem faster.  Only game I tried was Mortal Combat, which was smooth and worked well.  The screen is generous, but a bit dark and smudges are annoying.

I chose this, because I still have a house phone, and I don't want to spend $600 on a phone I will only use out of the house. I'm home a lot.

First of all, I LOVE the cute robin's egg blue box it came in. So many phones come in these enormous packages...why? This one is perfect.

The phone itself was easy to set up, and I didn't have any problem adding my SIM cards. When I turned it back on after installing them, all my stuff was immediately accessible. Fantastic.

I've messed around with games and apps, they all have great response time and are easy to move. The camera is more than adequate for my needs, and I love all the little editing tools that are included.

I like a clean phone with most apps in the folder, so I installed Nova with no issue. Looks great, works great. I love it.","5.0 out of 5 stars"

PROS:
-The look and build of the phone is top tier.
-Texting works fast and efficiently... because there are no other positives this is actually a positive.

CONS:
-The phone is extremely laggy and cannot handle gaming even though it claims to have high-end internal components. Games will freeze while whatever loads. You won't know if it crashed or is loading. Referring to 3D games.
-Calls are horrible - I'm in a major city on AT&T and the calls volumes go up and down and up and down and fade out. It's like I'm using the first cell phone.
- This phone can't handle loading the ads before a youtube video on 150mb internet over wifi. This is beyond unacceptable... how in the hell can you sell a product that can't function with the most basic of apps built into the phone.

I'm not sure how anyone has rated this phone higher, they must not actually do anything but text. On AT&T in a major city the phone performance is horrible, my calls constantly break up with volume going up and down. The interface is laggy, Games are laggy so laggy using a real phone like the Iphone 6s or Galaxy S6 the loading circle will spin... On this phone even though it claims similar specs... the loading circle will start a slight turn and freeze for however long it takes to load the program... The Asus Zenfone2 and ZTE Axom performed better. When using youtube, this phone can't handle the ad's that play before the video... it will freeze completely on 150mb wifi.... This is worse than an STD because you actually had to pay for it. I bought into the hype of thousands of positive reviews only to wonder what phone they're using. I would of kept this phone and enjoyed it if it performed half as good as the ""flagship"" phones as it claimed. It performs like the 50$ phones from piggy back or prepaid carriers while encased in a top tier design.","2.0 out of 5 stars"

Flagship specs at a below budget price. Bought this phone for my wife and she loves it.
She even dropped it in the tub while showering our toddler and it survived without any issues.
Tells you a lot about quality(**PHONE IS NOT WATER PROOF**).

Screen:
Amazing screen, yes its a 1080p screen but its one of the better 1080p screens out there. Rivals the iphone screen, i've seen them side
by side and Honor 5x might be a bit better.

Camera:
It does not have the best camera, but its an overall good camera. Compares to previous flagships like LG G2 and Galaxy S4.

Performance:
The phone originally is in a sort of power saving mode. and you might notice hiccups here and there.
But once you change it to normal mode, you will not have any hiccups, this thing flies!

Battery:
The battery on this thing is amazing!!! It easily lasts my wife the entire day.
average on screen time is anywhere from 4.5 - 6hrs. This is not bad at all, up there with current flagships.

I have recommended this product to a few of our family and friends looking to replace and old phone
but not wanting to spend a fortune. So far have had 3 converts.","5.0 out of 5 stars"

After using the 5x for 3 weeks, I am astound that I have all these nice smart phone features and build quality at my finger tips, for exactly the same price I paid for the LG F3. There are many positive reviews on the build quality, price/performance and hardware already, and I concur in general with those reviews;I no longer run out of space and having to tolerate a low resolution screen. The 5x' hardware is great, but there are a few rough edges on the usages. Here are a few I found combersome that prevent me from giving 5 stars: 1) take 4 touches to enable/disable mobile data (i.e. Setting-> More -> Mobile Netwwork ->On/Off); the UI try to compensate this inconvenience via a Short Cut, yet the drop down menu is shared between the Short Cut and Notification. 2) Finger print works great, and finger print management allows only a maximum of 5 prints. 3) The orientation of the return pointer (that triangular pointer) is inconsistent; sometimes points to the left, sometimes to the up. 4) Coming from the F3, I love the camera's panorama shot. Wait, changing the scan direction (left-to-right vs right-to-left, and N-to-S vs S-to-N) is not intuitively obvious as in my daughter's Samsung S6. For the 5x, one has to physically rotate the phone 180 degree to switch the direction. Weird? Well, for its price and features, I will live with these annoyances.","4.0 out of 5 stars"

I got this phone about two weeks ago, and I really wanted to love it.  I've been reading about it and excited by Huawei's advertising for it since December 2015.  I snagged it on a deal from Amazon Warehouse deals for $159, and I haven't seen it at that price since.  The phone came basically new.

Out of the box, the phone feels like a million bucks.  No iPhone or Samsung or OnePlus can hold a candle to the looks of this thing.  The gold metal simply shines and gleams so bright, for a second you might think you're Goldfinger from Austin Powers.  Not tacky actually, it somehow comes across as tasteful and fashionable, people seem to really like it and ask about it. The phone has gotten me more attention than a puppy.  So if that's your game, by all means...

But...if what you want is a great smart phone...that's a whole different story.  This can be a great smart phone, but not right out of the box.
The system software that comes with this phone, Huawei's implementation of Android called EMUI is dreadfully laggy.  It seems to freeze up and get confused doing the simplest task switching.  Many forums recommend switching power management to Normal, as it comes default on a power saving mode, which is mostly unnecessary as the phone has a very good battery.  It's also recommended you switch your commonly used apps to ""protected"" mode.  But for me all this was not enough.  Running more than two apps and the thing still lagged.

But there's more out there to fix it, and I went there.  I unlocked the bootloader, which is easy to do by registering with Huawei and then rooted the phone (also fairly easy).  This may void the warranty, so if that matters to you and you don't know how to bring it back to stock think twice.

Rooting the phone let me boost the processor speed, remove unnecessary apps and Huawei bloatware, but most importantly removing EMUI and replacing it with a faster launcher less known to freeze - there are many out there.  I also used shell scripts to stop zram swap storage and remove unnecessary Android processes like NFC which is not available with this phone.

Even with all this, the phone will bog down running larger apps like Spotify, Facebook and streaming video if you are trying to do other things in the background.  It's gaming performance is so-so as well.  I think it is held back by only having 2gb of ram and a poor implementation of the system software.

However, the processor may also be to blame.  Although this is an octa-core, Antutu benchmark shows it having poor performance when compared to other octa-core phones like the Oneplus two and even some older ones like the Nexus 6.

Honestly, at times it feels slower than my two year old quad core phone that I would switch back to if the earpiece hadn't broken and the speaker given out do to my son watching too much Thomas the Tank videos on it while waiting in the supermarket with me.

Overall, I cannot give this phone a strong recommendation, unless you are determined to have a dual sim or are willing to accept some problems with the possibility of better firmware coming down the line or finding a custom rom and rooting the phone and working with it to speed it up.

In the end, I'm keeping the phone, it has an excellent camera with better low light performance i'm finding than other reviewers might give it credit for and reception on Cricket in the DC area is far better than other phones I've had. GPS also locks on very quickly. It is a very customizable phone for folks that are willing to root, but again, the firmware and lag are a serious negative.

Update and post script 5-11-16 (less than 30 days ownership):
I had amazing LTE coverage with this phone on the Cricket network in DC, which runs on ATT here. I tried Cyanogen 13 on it but it had many bugs which, although much faster than the stock rom or even debloated stock rom, was just not good for daily use. I ultimately had to return the phone when it began to have problems reading the SD card under any rom, and corrupted 3 SD cards in the course of a few days. I may have gotten a bad manufacture one off, but between the lag, the not yet ready for prime time 3rd party roms and then the SD card corruption issue, it was time for it to go...all in about 30 days. Fortunately, Amazon was willing to take it back after the stated 15 day period.","1.0 out of 5 stars"

If you want to experience VR I would find another phone.  (may change my review some other time, if by some chance the creatre same phone with proper features)

*Edit*  I decied to edit my review..  Phone itself  in the hand is indeed as amazing as other say.  pretty smooth operation though could do with more ram.  Fingerprint scanner is amazing.

Phone size:  ok world  can we all just calm down?  any bigger and well be walking around holding tablets to our ears lol.

storage space: literally best ive seen on a phone in this range.

Sim/SD swapping:  literally a breeze! I use straight-talk.  I had to call their customer support (  oddly enough honor x5 imei is not accepted)  the tech support asked me if I used the phone after i inserted my old sim.  Sure enough with NO set up everything was working as is.

Camera: not great but it will certainly get the job done.  I used a lumia 635 for a year or more, and that phone has no flash.

audio:  could do with another speaker to give stereo sound, but lil thing is sure LOUD. god help you if you forget to lower ringtone when it first arrives.

Comes with screen protector pre-installed: great! hate doing that myself.

Battery: pretty good but man they could do with fast charging, cuz it takes this thing a while.

Web browsing:  great, video playback and all.

USB OTG:  apparently is ""on the phone, but needs to be enabled by software""  as of right now, however its still unavailable.

(Suggestions)

 Huawei/Honor 5x team should certainly  look into having a sort of ""trade-in"" program.  That way we the users can recycle old model phones,  and get new ones that have small interations of improvements vs the last phone.  The manufacture can recycle old units for the materials. Win win for all!

Gyroscope:  its a requirement, world is stepping into VR territory, no one wants to be left behind.

USB OTG:  need I say more?  enable it! lol

NFC:  common now,  how did you even leave this out??

Audio: coudlnt hurt to have the other ""faux speaker grill, actually be a working speaker"" other than that dont change a thing.","3.0 out of 5 stars"

For the casual, moderate user -- this phone will exceed expectations.","5.0 out of 5 stars"

I've had this phone for a couple of weeks at the time of this review.

Let me start this review by stating that I've had cell phones for nearly 20 years. I always tend to go ""middle of the road"" with my phone models, keep them 1-2 years, then get a new one. No flagships, but no junk, either. I've had LG, Samsung, Moto, etc. Most of the big players in the American market. I've never had an iPhone. I mention this to give a frame of reference on how my experience with cell phones has been formed.

When I was shopping for a phone, I had purchased an Alcatel Pop Idol 3 (4.7”), but had problems with a couple of units and ultimately decided to go with something different.  At this same time, the Honor 5X was released, and it looked like there were a lot of similarities that appealed to me, for a decent price. I won't re-hash the basic specs that you can read all over the internet, but I'll touch on some things that I've noted and liked/disliked in this review.

First impression of the phone: It has a very nice look about it. It's very thin and very light in the hand. The whole face of the unit is glass, and it comes with a plastic screen protector.  The aluminum back gives it a pretty high-quality look, overall. If it didn’t have the branding on the back, you’d easily think that this unit is much more expensive than it really is. No complaints.

After inserting my SIM and SD cards, and charging up for a bit, I turned on the unit. It walked me through a pretty standard set-up routine. I put my usual apps on it, ran updates, etc. Right from the start, I noticed that I really, REALLY, disliked the UI.  (I will go into detail on this below.)

My observations:
-The Fingerprint reader is really, really fantastic.  I’ve never had one before, and I just thought it would be a gimmick that I wouldn’t care for.  I was wrong.  As I pull my phone out of my pocket, I can have it un-locked by the time I’m looking at the screen.  I’m not taking full advantage of all of its features, but the few features I am using are really handy.  This may be one of the most stand-out features on this phone.

-To me, the most important thing with a cell phone is its ability to function like a phone. It seems weird to feel the need to state this, but I bet a lot of people rarely actually call people and talk to them w/ their cell phones. I have T-Mobile, and while I generally don't have reception issues, my neighborhood actually seems to be pretty spotty and my last phone would often drop calls in certain sections of my neighborhood. In my house, I would often have to use my wi-fi to make calls. The Honor 5X’s reception is pretty good, overall, but not great. Calls sound just “OK”.  Nothing remarkable.

-The speaker on the Honor 5X is fairly average. Music sounds OK on the speakers, as long as volume is kept below max.  Speaker phone calls are a bit “tinny” sounding. I wish that there were two speakers, for better sound distribution.  Overall, sound quality may be this phone’s weakest quality, in my opinion.

-The picture quality of the screen is quite good. Colors are good, images seem decently sharp. Not as nice as a Galaxy, or iPhone, but it’s definitely good for this price-level. I watched a bunch of Netflix, Youtube, etc. and I was really impressed overall.  No artifacts or anything distracting.  In super bright sunlight, this phone is just OK, but not many phones do well in that regard.  Otherwise: brightness, clarity, etc. are all very good.

-I found the size of the unit to be right on the edge of “too big”. I actually am a very tall guy, big hands, etc. and you would think that I'd like a bigger phone, but honestly, I like to be able to put the phone in my pocket, or be able to access all of the functions with one hand.  This is all personal preferences, of course, but I like to mention it.

-The battery life is very good, even on the lowest battery-saving setting.  I am not exactly a ""heavy user"" but I do make calls, check emails, check Twitter, and watch the occasional vid. I don't really do games, aside from the occasional solitaire. I leave the wifi and GPS on 24/7. At first, when I was setting this phone up and tweaking it, etc. I was worried because it seemed like the battery life was very poor.  Once I got everything set-up and finished updates, etc. I now easily get over a day before needing to charge. If I have particularly light usage during a day and don't watch any video, I can go almost 2 days before needing to plug-in.

-The cameras, both front and back, are pretty good, I think. I take a lot of pictures for work and hobbies, but not for ""portraits"" or anything like that, more record-keeping. My requirements are pretty low. I can say that with good lighting, the rear camera takes very nice pictures. If you're used to phones in this price range, the cameras are going to seem pretty normal. I don’t like the way that the camera sticks out from the back of the phone, as I find that it catches on my pocket, or it seems like you’re bound to scratch the lens when you set the phone down on its back.  I bought a case that solves this problem, but I think Honor should have incorporated the lens a little more smoothly into the design of the phone.

As for what I didn't like about the phone:

-This phone takes FOREVER to fully charge.  It has been noted that the included charger is a 1-amp charger, which is baffling with a battery this large.  Even using a 2-amp charger, this phone still takes ages to fully charge.  I think a fully-charged battery should get most people through a full day, though, so it shouldn’t generally be a problem.  If you are a very heavy-duty user that is away from power for extended periods, then you probably carry a power-bank anyways.

-I just do not care for the native UI on this phone, and this is the reason I rated this phone 4 stars vs. 5 stars. It is so cluttered and hard to personalize.  And not having an app-drawer is seriously annoying. I thought all of the reviews about this phone were exaggerating about this point, but they are not.  I am not any kind of expert on Android's different iterations. I don't tweak my phones, or run different ROMS or anything like that.  I’ve never loaded a different launcher on a phone before.  When I first received this phone, I found the IOS-like interface to be so hard to work with that I followed the many online recommendations to load a different launcher.  I went with Google’s app launcher, and it really made this phone so much better.  If I were not able to do this, I probably would have returned this phone.  This is a highly personal preference, and somebody else may prefer to have the EMUI’s features.  I did not.

My recommendation to anybody that buys this phone:  Search Youtube for ways to optimize this phone.  It really takes this phone to the next level.  Set the battery savings setting to its lowest level (don’t worry, it still lasts a long time).  Get a different app launcher.  This phone has taken more effort than any other phone I’ve had to get it set up the way that I like, but I think it’s worth it in the end.

The bottom line:  Despite my criticisms above, I would recommend this phone to others, and I have no regrets in purchasing it.  I think if you have realistic expectations of a mid-range phone, then you will be happy with this.","4.0 out of 5 stars"

================

Interestingly, I recently read an article where Huawei was partnering with Google to make the next version of the Nexus 7 tablet for this April/May 2016. And when I saw that Huawei had their own line of phones, this made me very interested as I 'assume' Google wouldn't partner with them if the quality was poor. Thus I had high expectations for this phone and so far I'm not disappointed.

================

I currently have the Galaxy S5 (2014), which has been a great phone.

I searched Google and found several web sites with the technical specs for this phone versus the Galaxy S5. See if you can find a side-by-side comparison site and it will help put things into perspective.

================

PROCESSOR:
Honor has 1.5Ghz processor with 8 cores = should make for good multitasking and it seems to.
I've ran 3 games at once -- all updating on Internet simultaneously -- and I didn't loose progress or have lag.

MEMORY:
The 2Gb RAM of memory is a very welcome addition (same as Samsung) as videos stream or play locally very well. Playing a driving game I had no lag. Web pages load pretty fast via Chrome browser.

DISPLAY:
Display Resolution: 1080 x 1920, same as Samsung. This offers a great viewing screen with clarity and good brightness.
The screen is 5.5 inches versus the Samsung is 5.10. That half inch difference is very noticeable next to each other. . .I definitely like the larger screen! Since I take all my pictures with my phone, I'll try and find another camera and show the phones side-by-side so you can see too.

SPACE:
The 16Gb 'hard drive'/SSD space (actual is 14.9Gb) left me with 10.51Gb free (9.84Gb actual). Thus still a good amount of room to install a bunch of apps. No way will my music fit on this or pictures, but that is what the MicroSD/TFT is for. After installing 20+ apps I'm down to 7.5Gb with my dropbox files storing to the MicroSD card instead of the device memory. There are some games that are 1Gb or larger (a few at least), so I still have room for more stuff.

MICRO SD:
Supports up to a 128Gb MicroSD card. I currently have a 32Gb installed. MicroSD was recognized without any issue and is able to save/write files and read files pretty fast. No issues playing a movie file. . .once I downloaded a good video app like MX Player. I didn't like the default video player it came with as it didn't have the codec needed to play my video file.

BATTERY:
Battery on the samsung is 2800 mAh and is replaceable. The Honor has a 3000 mAh, but is NOT replaceable. The Honor battery does seems to last longer, but no ejecting the battery if the system gets stuck. They removable sticker on the back (see image) says to hold the Power Button down for 10seconds to do a hard reset.

I do not have a rapid charger, but I'm getting between 43% to 50% charge per hour of charging. Hopefully that gives you an idea how fast this battery charges.

DUAL SIM:
Why Do You Want a Dual-SIM phone?
A phone with two SIM cards can hold two numbers and two identities at once. You can make or receive calls and send or receive texts on either number and give each number only to the people that you chose.
EXAMPLE: When traveling to Greece, you can keep your local US number and then add in a temporary Greece number as you cruise around the Mediterranean.  You could have your 'personal' phone number plus a separate work number running at the same time and keep the calls separate. You could also use one SIM for calls and if you have a better plan with another carrier for data, you could choose to use the 2nd SIM for data. Great feature!

NOTE: I put my AT&T SIM into this device and rebooted. Connected immediately to 4G LTE and received calls. No issues!!
According to the manufacturer specs, you can get 4G with either of the two SIM slots.

CONNECTIONS:
Phone has Bluetooth 4.1 and Wi-Fi b/g/n. Thus connecting to networks and devices is a snap.

The specs say this has a USB connection through the MicroUSB (charging) port. See photo of an app that says the phone is USB ready. I have an on-the-go (OTG) cable show up on Sunday 1/24 but I couldn't get it to work. I have an email into customer service asking for assistance.

TETHERING:
USB tethering worked immediately upon plugging the phone into the laptop. I was browsing the Internet pretty fast on my laptop through the phone's connection.

Bluetooth tethering, I had to make my laptop 'discoverable' before the unit would show up properly and I could bluetooth the phone with the laptop. Once it did, it worked well, but was a bit more of a process with the old bluetooth tech on my laptop. Other two options were much easier.

WiFi hotspot worked easily. I was connected and browsing Internet without trouble. What helped was putting in my own custom password into the settings. Must be at least 8-characters long.

OTHER FEATURES:
Yes, it has GPS.
Yes, it has an accelerometer.
Yes, it has fingerprint feature for identification / taking photos / launching apps / lock or unlock mode / answering calls / canceling an alarm

CAMERA:
13MP camera and a 5MP selfie camera. Thus when Skyping you'll come through very clear! True the Samsung has a 16MP camera. . .a bit better but not a huge difference. But it also has a poor 1 or 2MP selifie camera, which is often unclear I find. The upgraded Honor front camera is another great addition.

Added outdoor and indoor pictures taken with Honor 5x and Galaxy s5, using default settings. The Galaxy seems brighter is the only real difference I can tell.

HOW-TO:
My box did NOT come with a user manual and I could not find a 'support' link clearly marked on Huawei's site. Thus good luck with figuring some things out. . .though Android operating system is fairly intuitive.

OVERALL:
This is very comparable in many ways to my older phone, but they have just the right amount of upgrades that make this phone stand out. It is working great for me and even shipped with a screen protector.

Now to find a case that won't take 6-8 weeks to ship from China and doesn't have only little girl colors. So far that is proving more difficult than you'd think.","5.0 out of 5 stars"

It is a nice mash up of andriod and iOS. I have had both phones in the past and I prefer this platform over both. The fingerprint scanner is also a great touch which unlocks super fast. I wish I could give this phone 4.5/5 stars. The only reason I can not give it a 5 is because I have had issues with my speaker. Sometimes when I talk to people on the phone they tell me I sound muffled or like I am underwater.

After using it for some time, I am pretty confident in my rating for this phone.  Even with my rating, I still recommend this phone. Here is how I divide it up:

Physical Phone/ hardware – 5 Stars
Android software (the modified version on this phone) – 1 Star

(I would give 2.5 stars if I could, since that would be the average.  But I think the physical phone itself is so good, that I decided to round up rather than down)

The phone itself is awesome.  It runs pretty quick for not being a top of the line phone.  After owning several prepaid phones, the 16 gb internal memory is a must.  I would not buy any phone that does not have at least the 16.  Great processor and ram memory.  The phone itself looks good I suppose.  I am not really one for looks.  It could have been a plastic phone and I would have been fine with it.  The finger print scanner works great!  I have never used any other phone with one, but from what I have heard some are not very good.  The physical hardware on this phone is awesome.  Unfortunately the android software is terrible.
The longer I have had this phone, the more I hate what they did to Android.  The EMUI that they run on it is no good.  I never use apple products, so it supposedly resembles the iPhone.  To alleviate this problem,  I downloaded the Google Now launcher.  However, this is where I have run into the biggest problem.  Just randomly, the phone will go back to the original launcher.  Since there was no system setting I could find for this, (and google now launcher was not listed in my apps) I had to download another launcher that would show me the setting to change the default launcher.  It has done this about 4 times since I got the phone.  I hate it!  Drives me crazy.  Very frustrating
The other issue was trying to get apps to push notifications to the lock screen.  Not only do you have to allow it in your notification center, but you have to go to the Batter Saver area of the phone and allow it there as well.  I had to do quite a bit of research to figure out why I was not getting any notifications.  Plus, sometimes it works and other times it does not.  Since these same apps worked on my previous Android phone, it must be a problem with this one.
If I had the time and ability, I would root this phone and put stock android on it.  If this phone came with the stock android, it would be a 5 star phone.  That is my suggestion to the makers of the phone:  Get rid of the terrible android you are trying to put on here and just use the one straight from Google.  You will have a better phone.
Even with all the downsides of the Android software, I still recommend this phone.  I am hoping the Marshmallow update will fix some of the problems.  It is, however, still a pretty good phone for the price.  Just be prepared to get frustrated with it and get used to how their version of Android works.","3.0 out of 5 stars"

However, I was kind of sad to see the honor 5x go. It was only slightly lower in performance/benchmark than the Nexus, and the build quality and materials were very nice to look at. In the end though, for the same money there was no question the Nexus 5x was the better buy. The only downsides to the honor I found in my couple weeks with it is that it doesn't pickup 5ghz wifi bands and you have to be OK with a pretty highly ""applefied"" OS. Also the screen protector is pretty cheesy.

But the battery life and screen are great! The fingerprint sensor works at least as well as the Nexus, and hasa couple nice tweaks too. Overall I was very happy with the huawei and also grateful for Amazon's amazing return policy","4.0 out of 5 stars"

It was time for me to upgrade after years of issues with the GPS on every version of the Samsung Galaxy Note (versions 1, 2, 3, 4 - all on ATT)  After much research I finally pulled the trigger on this phone, knowing full well it was a mid range to budget phone.  I was VERY impressed with the phone initially...

-Sleek and sexy all metal body
-Fingerprint scanner is very quick (I was always one who saw them as gimmicky, until this one.  Having it on the back is great, except if you have a magnetic car holder like myself, then it's a bit annoying to have to take it off, unlock it, and put it back)
-Bigger screen than I was expecting, just as big as my Note 4.  If you want a small phone, this isn't the one for you! (See pic)
-I was worried about the lower 1920x1080 (1080p) resolution, but honestly couldn't tell the difference between this screen and the Note 4's that has a higher resolution of 2560x1440 (1440p)
-Camera takes great pics, focuses much faster than the Note 4
-Huawei freely offers the unlock code to anyone who wants it (for those interested in rooting their phone)

So after a couple weeks, I was very happy and feeling lucky that I had found such great, affordable phone... but then it all turned south in a hurry.  Like most other smartphone owners, I had slapped on a screen protector and case on day 1.  I took the phone out of the case to get all the dust and garbage out that collects between the two.  That's when I noticed the phone wasn't lying flat on the table... on closer inspection, I was terrified to notice that the phone was actually bent so that two of the opposite corners were higher than the other two.  Thankfully I was able to carefully bend it back to where it was flat again.  (It seemed to be bending from the phone being in my back pocket while sitting, I'm a very average 160 lbs if you're curious)  Nothing else seemed to be affected by the phone playing a yoga instructor, so I chalked it up to something I'd have to deal with due to it's price.  Sadly, a few days later, I started noticing the phone mysteriously rebooting by itself.  After a little troubleshooting, I noticed that the metal body had started to fatigue from all those yoga moves and bent to the point where it started pushing against the power button, causing it to stick (see pics).  So while the phone is amazing for the price, this major flaw makes it unusable unless you decide to get a big, bulky case to help keep it rigid while in your pocket.  This defeats the purpose of having a sleek phone in the first place.  Huawei did return my email within 4 hours, but the rep did not have much in terms of solutions...

here's a part of his email:  ""Thank you for contacting Honor support. Interesting, I can see how that is an issue. As for fixing an issue like this, that would be a problem. We currently don't have a repair center setup yet, even if we did that's an issue that we wouldn't be able to fix as it voids the warranty. I would highly suggest sending it to Amazon for a return or replacement before your warranty or buyers remorse is up.""

Hopefully this helps everyone decide one way or another on this phone and please feel free to ask questions and I'll keep an eye out for them!

UPDATE:

I called Huawei Support (a rep asked me to do so in a reply to this review) and spoke to Chris at ext.44014. After asking me several times if I had dropped or otherwise damaged the phone, and me telling him that I've had the phone in a case since day 1, he basically implied that having the phone in my back pocket voids the warranty. WOW! I'd be furious if I didn't have the option to return it to Amazon. I'm sorry for keeping it my back pocket and damaging your phone, I must have missed those instructions in the fine print along with your less than stellar warranty policy.","2.0 out of 5 stars"

Are generally from comparisons against flagship <top-of-the-line> devices, the performance of this device lands squarely between a galaxy s4 and s5 but with a pricetag cheaper than either.

Complaints about EMUI 3.x are largely unfounded, it's very customizable, fast, and for the most part glitch-free but it does have a bad reputation from older versions of the launcher. People like to trash-talk it still, but honestly it's one of the better factory launchers and you can always use a 3rd party one if you prefer. Once you are familiar with the UI <which takes about 24 hours> then you will fully appreciate how clean and smooth it really is, but you will spend a large part of that first day trying to find where everything is.

Camera has many options and takes excellent pictures in all but the harshest conditions <very low light>, burst shooting mode will snap 10 pictures per second so a large sdhc card is recommended :)

Honor is currently accepting beta test applicants for Android Marshmellow and EMUI 4.x, the phone will be upgrading to both but with no scheduled release date currently.

Tmobile band 12 is still currently deactivated until a deal can be struck, blame the lawyers for the delay. 4GLTE works flawlessly with AT&T if you have the carried option in your area.

For anyone seriously considering this phone you should also order a tempered glass screen protector and immediately replace the factory plastic one, basically it's just shipped with it so the screen is protected from initial use but it should be replaced with a real GLASS protector asap.","5.0 out of 5 stars"

Being 16gb phone only, it does have an expansion slot for micro SD so thats good in case you need additional storge. The phone also packs 2 sim card slots, 1 mini and 1 mico sim slot. This is a great feature if you want to travel aboard so you can have your sim from the states and local sim at where you are staying. Only thing missing is NFC so people looking into using NFC for payment will have to skip this phone.

The only real complain I have is that the android skin Huawei uses doesnt have an app drawer. To fix this I installed Google Now Launcher. This also made the phone more like a Nexus phone.","5.0 out of 5 stars"

It is fully charged in about 3 hours, which is not that much different from my previous phones. Camera is great, too, not sure why some people say it is not good enough. It is perfectly good enough for me for what I expect from a cell phone, i attached few pictures. The phone works very well, fast enough. I purchased also 32 GB SD card. I will be getting one for my husband soon, too. And if the phone will not last more than maybe 1 year? No big deal, for the $200 i will just get a new one!!!!

You can't really compare it to a high-end phone, but it does most everything a smart phone needs to do.

Battery life is decent, not great - will last a few hours on heavy use. Build quality is good - the back is aluminum and feels much more solid than plastic phones (like the Nexus 5X). The screen is OK, not anywhere close to the high end phones, but completely serviceable. The UI is not very good, but I replaced it with a 3rd party launcher and it mostly feels fine. Processor is OK - phone can be sluggish at times, but it's to be expected for the price range. Fingerprint sensor can be fidgety, but most other phones in this range don't have one at all. Has expandable microsd for storage, as well as room for a second sim if you travel frequently.

The main disappointment is the camera - camera can take a long time to start up (which can make you lose good shots) and pictures are just decent, not great. Also lacks a 5ghz antenna.

Overall, I use this as my main phone and it's held up well over the past two months. It's a very practical phone if you customize the UI and settings to your preferences.","4.0 out of 5 stars"

Battery life is pretty good. It lasts me the entire day on medium to heavy load.

Love the metal back plate but under heavy load may get hot do definitely get a case if that bothers you.

Moreorver, the phone doesn't have Marshmallow yet but the phone is great as is. Processing speed is fast and the finger print read is responsive.... Sometimes too much where it exits my apps. But that's just user error since I used to have a LG G2.

Physically, the phone is super fine. Has a nice 'heft' to it (metal casing), nice screen size, well machined and designed. I get all 'squooshy' over beautifully made things - little teeny buttons that work so nice, that kind of thing. So this unit satisfied that need very nicely!

I was hoping the FHD screen would knock my socks off, the way the Samsung Note 5 et al always do - dazzling screens. Alas, it didn't exactly do that. It's plenty nice, don't get me wrong, but do I detect a smashing difference between this screen (1080x1920), vs the 720x1080 or something like that that it replaced? Nope, sorry - I just don't notice the difference. Maybe there's something wrong with my eyesight, because all reviewers just rave about the beautiful screen. But I'm beginning to suspect that they're actually just raving about the SPECS for the screen - yes, 1080x1920 is a huge UP from a 720x1080 screen. Sadly, however, the theoretical huge bump just doesn't translate to a huge visual bump.

First thing I did was install the Arrow launcher - my very favorite. Then ... I was pretty lost after that actually. Floundering. It astonishes me how much the Android o/s differs from one phone to another. My previous phone had Android 5.0, and this one has Android 5.1. One would think it would be a snap adjusting from one to the other. But - and this really is scarcely covered in the many reviews I read of the Honor 5x - Huawei uses their own GUI on this phone. Just takes quite a bit of getting used to I guess. It has WAAAY more Android setting choices than my previous phone (which I am beginning to love more and more for it's simplicity). Mercy, they're all over the place. And Huawei adds all sorts of apps that I neither need nor want, and can't delete (haven't tried all that hard, but there's no 'uninstall' button when I review the Apps tab in Settings). That always ticks me off - manufacturers stuffing software on a PC or phone. I mean, some of this stuff even had ads in them. Wouldn't be so bad if I could just opt out and uninstall it, but ... well, I'll have to see if I can find an app that will let me kill off some of this stuff.

My previous phone, btw, was a BLU LIFE ONE. Just a little 1GB memory, 8GB storage unit. I thought that buying this Honor 5x unit would improve everything - more memory, more disk space, how could I lose? Well, I didn't really lose - but I didn't 'win' anything either. The BLU was, I do believe, even zippier that the Honor 5x! That was a real slap in the face. And my concerns about running out of memory on the BLU were ... ignorance on my part. I just read that Android is built to really stuff the memory chip (by holding loads of programs open in memory), then closing old unused programs as needed. So you don't really run out of memory. !! Now they tell me .. haha

The fingerprint sensor works well. But - another thing that reviewers fail to note - to use the fingerprint feature, you MUST also use an unlock pin code. Gotta do both or none at all. So, no big deal I think ... I did the fingerprint and PIN routine. For about 2 hours! Super tedious entering the PIN or fingerprint every few minutes, when waking up the phone from sleep. Oy. I don't keep any secret stuff on my phone anyway. You won't find any nude photos of me floating around the internet - and you can thank your lucky stars for that! Ay - maybe I can play with it and find a happy medium for locking but not being so darned intrusive. ? More play time needed.

I sound really 'down' on this phone - but I'm not. It's a lovely phone at a lovely price. I would never (EVER) pay $500 or $600 for a phone - it just won't ever happen. I can afford it, but it's simply not worth it.  This is probably as close as I can come to a premium phone at a non-premium price. Of course, we all know that in ... 4 months? 6 months? ... I'll be able to get MORE features, and a BETTER screen, and more doo dahs,  for just a few pennies more. The lure of the tech stuff! But I think I can live with this phone for many years and be very happy and content.

So - no, I'm not down on this unit and yes, I would buy it again. I just wanted you to have my unvarnished comments on some of the less discussed points that came as a bit of a shock to me.","4.0 out of 5 stars"

Many people don't like the stock UI, but I like it so far. Still preferred Windows Phone but I need an Android for development purposes and this fit the bill perfectly.
Frankly, mobile phone is so fast now that the speed is hardly matter. Since this is an Android phone, it really came down to stability and battery life.
This phone has very decent battery life. I used it all day today and still get 70% left when I plugged it in tonight. This is probably the best so far. The first few days, I would say 50% left at the end of the day. Not bad.
Stability wise, no crash thus far. Mostly very smooth. However, there are times when the phone is not very sensitive to touch. Not all the time, but sometime. I'm not sure what happened. It got annoying sometime, but that doesn't last long enough to really make me mad :-). The photo quality is not as good as iPhone or my old Lumia but good enough for casual picture taking. If I am serious about taking good picture, I would use my DSLR.
In general, I am very pleased with this phone. I'm making the phone's CPU for a living, so I am very familiar with phones. There are phones out there that may be 30% faster than this, but do you really need that? If you do, then you would need to shell out $500 more. Just not worth it for me.
Even at $200, I would consider this a high-end phone quality (vs. premium like iPhone, Samsung etc.) due to its solid build and good software. Mind you, it's a Huawei phone, so if you are brand sensitive, make sure you change your default email signature :-)","5.0 out of 5 stars"

The UI is different from stock Android--the phone runs on Android 5.1 and has a skin from Huawei, EMUI 3.0, which almost has an iOS flavor to it, as some people have probably noticed and commented.  I am familiar with both operating systems (Android and Apple, though I prefer Android) and for me, this is kind of refreshing.

Overall it is a great phone - a build quality is very good, so are technical specs; and pricing is very good.

Cons:

while the phone is advertised as dual-sim; only one of the sims can support 3G / 4G at a time (the other one defaults to 2G); in some countries like Japan there is no 2G service; making the other sim card obsolete; a rather major drawback; really wish that huawei included at least 3G for the 2nd sim.

Support from Honor is spotty to non-existent, at best.  User ""blogs""  seem to only concentrate on the positive reviews  of their  device. NOT a bad word from anyone having problems, such as I.  Makes me wonder if they're not ""editing"" their reviews?","3.0 out of 5 stars"

I also have tried the Nexus 6p and Samsung Galaxy S7. I have been trying to find a good replacement for my HTC One M7 that I really loved, and unfortunately, this phone missed the mark badly.

The Good:
-Cheap at $200
-Expandable storage
-Decent Camera
-Decent battery life

The Bad
-After using it, $200 seemed like a rip off and I paid too much.
-Really bad screen. Not touch sensitive and you could really see the lack of high resolution.
-Terrible performance. Very sluggish, very laggy. My 30 month old HTC M7 was faster.
-Bluetooth experience was awful with random disconnects for no good reason, forcing me to repair it with my devices constantly.
-Audio quality was terrible.
-No updates. No Marshmallow. The UI this phone uses is a hot mess.

The Ugly
-The headphone jack stopped working about 7 days in. Anytime you plugged in headphones, horrible static would occur. The only way I was able to listen to music was through Bluetooth, which was already giving me problems. I would guess this was a defect, but it didn't come out of the box like that, and I kept it in great condition in a clean environment so clearly it just quickly degraded.

I don't typically post negative reviews but I had to on this phone. I highly recommend to stay clear of this phone. It is not worth it to save $100 and pass on a Nexus 5x, a moto x pure, or even the OnePlus X (which I loved). What is funny is once you start up this phone, the slogan for it is ""For the brave"". Yes, you must be very, VERY brave to use this as your phone.","1.0 out of 5 stars"

It is an android phone so if you are familiar with the android system this should be familiar in most regards. Let me go over some of the less typical features: first, the back does not come off of this and the battery is not accessible to the user. If you have a problem with the battery, you are required to get it serviced. As a result, to insert the sim cards and micro sd card, there are two little drawers that open up on the side. To open them, you need to insert a pin tool which is provided(don't lose it!). As I am sure you noticed, it has a fingerprint recognition system. You do not have to implement it unless you wish. Keep in mind that some people(like myself!) do not have viable fingerprints. Also, fingerprint quality can change(such as dried cracked skin from winter dryness and injury to the finger). I do not recommend relying on fingerprint systems. If you use fingerprint recognition as your only phone lock and one day your phone no longer recognizes your fingerprint(perhaps because you got a cut on your finger), then what will you do? I don't know if you can set it up so that you can override the fingerprint recognition with a pin number; that would be nice, but I don't want to experiment with that. But the fingerprint button can also be used to trigger the camera(it can also be set up to trigger other functions, such as answering a call and you don't need to set up fingerprint recognition to do that) and you don't need to set that up; it is the default; of course, you can also trigger the camera with the on-screen button. I liked the file navigation on this phone. I had no problem navigating to the micro sd(I loaded it with the files I needed before inserting it into the phone) as I have had with other android phones. One problem with this phone is that there is no documentation at all and I do mean none. Even on the website there is no documentation and nothing to download. The only way to learn about this phone is to explore the phone. Since most of you are already familiar with android phones, this is not a big problem. It is just strange. If you are not familiar with the android system, you should be able to apply information from other android phones to this, more or less. Documentation may become available when this phone hits the market since the phone I have was given to me as an advanced distribution for evaluation. The quality of sound and image are as good as it gets, just as you would expect from a phone like this. The octo-core processor is also state-of-the-art. The feel of the phone in your hand is great, being very slim and lightweight. It comes with a screen protector already installed. As far as phones go in this price range, this is great!
Here are the network specs(from their website):
Network Rate  LTE FDD:B2/B4/B5/B12/B17 WCDMA:B1/B2/B4/B5 GSM:850/900/1800/1900MHz
It also has excellent WI-FI reception. Sources cite the WI-FI for this phone as 802.11n standard at 2.4GHz","5.0 out of 5 stars"

- Speedy finger prints (suffered from Samsung Tab S's clumsy and unreliable swipe finger print, this is heaven.)
- Good battery standby (2% decrease overnight)

On the minus side, when I take a phone call, the screen goes complete dark and can't bring it back by touching (you can get it back by click the power key), also the speaker voice sometimes feels tapering off ... need more time to get used to; Also, the default system font feels weird, so it is thin and small, and doesn't match with the rest of the fonts.

Bottom line: the best in its class. Hoping for Marshmallow update.

Update: after a month, Honor 5X received its first update and it is a letdown ... First, the update itself is a 125MB package without any note on what it is for; Second, and more important to the take off of one star: after the update, two apps are added and put on, both seems to be advertisement, one is hotel booking, the other is a link to store. I think this is really a low play for such a nice phone. For some company like Huawei aspiring to be international and a premium brand, whatever the revenue coming with these two ad. app (which btw a common practice among Chinese mobile vendors) are just *NOT* worth it.","3.0 out of 5 stars"
"","","A really good smart phone at this price range. I am especially impressed by the quality of cameral and the quality of the video. The battery is also quite reliable, which in my case, it serves at least the same length if not more than iPhone does. Many useful Apps are pretty preinstalled like google map, youtube etc... I had used two iPhones in the last 4 years before i switched to this Huawei Honor phone and i love it a lot.

The bluetooth also works pretty good with my car system (VW google carplay). One thing i would hope that either Huawei or VW could solve is to simplify  the compatibility of this phone with VW car play system (e.g., if connect this phone with with a USB cable, all the apps could also be applied on my car screen). This looks like is more likely to be on VW side and I am  taking to VW dealer to see how they can make it easier.

Definitely a good solid phone (remember at this price especially). Huawei does offer other higher price phone like the Huawei Nexus series (500 bucks range) and a few more series at different price levels.  But if you are like me, who mainly use smart phones for phone calls, message, emails, cameras, videos watching, general app use and like to change cell phones very two years, this is a very good choice. Strongly recommend it.","5.0 out of 5 stars"

Used as my daily phone for 4 days now. Using it frequently during the day it works well mostly but does suffer some lag and random twitchy touch sensitivity. It's a slick design and has some high end features. But the trade offs make it a much less versatile choice for me than my Moto G 3rd gen 2g ram 16g memory. Comparing them side by side the Moto is definitely the ugly duckling. But the silly Chinese idea of the Honor's UI is just bad for my needs. I took off one star for screencast, which the manual clearly says is a pull down menu option (the Moto has it and i use it often at work during meetings to throw my phone's screen to the smart screen), and a second star off for lack of OTG support which their website specs it as having OTG support.

edit: added back a star for screencast, it's there, just doesn't find any connections
The Moto G 3rd gen with 2g ram and 16g mem is your better choice if you like a straight up android experience, and I believe it will get Marshmallow long before the Honor 5X. For 20 dollars more it is IMHO just a much better workhorse kind of a device.","4.0 out of 5 stars"

Only negatives, and why it only gets 4 stars, is it is too large, lacks NFC and an oleophobic coating to defeat fingerprints. My perfect smartphone size if 5"" so it isnt much bigger but it feels and looks much bigger. Also never been a fan of metal. Pick it up on a chilly morning and it is cold and big and unwieldy.

Lightweight, sturdy feeling build, nice big screen. Sleek, really, really sleek. It takes about 1.5-2 hours to charge fully. The battery will last all day with normal use.

My network is a local company and I checked to make sure it was GSM. I put the sim card in the phone and it worked perfectly.

The cameras are 13mp for the rear camera and 5 mp for the front camera, so you can get decent photos with it. It's not as good as a dedicated camera of course, but more than sufficient for daily photos and videos. It snaps pictures quickly in most lighting, and has different modes that are easy to access. I like how it does with close up photos of things like food and crafts, but it also does well with the bigger photos that I need to take at work.

Fast load, and it works with a few apps open at a time. It's the first phone I've had that really does work as a full time substitute for my tablet for working because it has a good enough screen and it's large enough to run the apps I need for my job. I wouldn't want to read a book on it, or watch a full length movie, but for day to day needs it works great.

Expandable memory can go up to 128 gbs. I have a 64 gb micro-sd in it now. Saving and loading data to/from the card is fast and easy.

Because the battery case can't be opened, and it needs to be serviced professionally, the sim cards and sd cards have their own slots. The phone comes with a small needle pointed tool to open the slots and they are secure once they are in there. Keep the tool someplace it won't get lost so you can get back to your cards if necessary.

I've been using it for about a week now, and it's been a joy. A solid performer with the higher end features like a fantastic display and good processing speed that I need.

One thing- this doesn't come with a manual. It's pretty intuitive because Android is very easy to use.","5.0 out of 5 stars"

I've had my Note 2 since the first day it was released and I have loved it. Now that we dropped big red I wanted to get an unlocked phone as I don't want any contracts. I didn't know anything about this phone a month ago. Luckily I stumbled across it. This phone is amazing! EMUI is a little different, but like most people I threw Nova Launcher on it and for the most part all of the negative EMUI stuff is gone. I threw a ST sim card and a 128 GB SD card in it. Huawei wasn't well know very much here in the West until they produced the Nexus 6p for Google and everyone took notice. This company had figured out exactly what people want out of a phone. Sure there are some things missing like NFC and ghz wifi, but it does have a fingerprint sensor which I have viewed as a gimmick since they started putting them on phones. Now that I have one and not just any one, but this one, I don't know how I loved without it before this. Relocating the sensor on the back of the phone is so intuitive. I can literally unlock my phone before it's even out of my pocket. That is how good and fast the honor 5x fingerprint sensor is. The battery last a ridiculously long amount of time. Here it is past 3 am and I've been using it all day and still have 65% battery at the moment.  I originally ordered the Grey version and they sent me the white version. Sent a message to customer support on Amazon and instead of me having to send the phone back and be without a phone they allowed me to keep the wrong 5x and send it back when I receive my Grey one. Very nice to see that kind of customer support.  I don't really know what else to say except if you have reservations, don't. You'll be happy with your purchase.","5.0 out of 5 stars"

Why are other phones so expensive?  This one came with a lot fewer of the stupid built in apps that I never used.  The Huawei UI seems OK....works fine.  Camara very nice...has good editing features and the multi focus option is nice if you are like me and always edit photos like you should anyway.  People don't understand that most all cameras only caputure ""averaged"" photos and that it is up to the user to bring them to life and emphasize the favoed qualities with editing software before showing them anyway.

I like this phone so far and my only complaint so far is it seems to be longer/taller than it should be.  Too much space on each end of the screen.  I don't know why all these manufacturers insist on making them look like iphones on the front.  The back is great.

Update - I have had this phone for about a week and I am very impressed.  I am also very impressed by the way the Huawei folks respond to these comments.  Taking the time to do that shows a lot of class and professionalism - nice to know someone reads these things.  Only one thing I can't figure out and that is how to hear directions in Google Maps.  For some reason I can't find the setting and I don't know if it the software or the phone.  Probably not the phone's fault.","5.0 out of 5 stars"

I have had all the flagship phones, I usually buy unlocked phones since I use Straight Talk as my provider because I hate the carrier gimmicks. So when I spent $200 for the 5X versus my LG G4 International version that was $400. Or LG V10 was $500.  I didn't expect to be blown away for the price. WOW I WAS WRONG! Huawei makes awesome phones its just no one knows the brand because Samsung, LG & Apple dominate the US market.

Pros:
*Battery lasts all day and charges 100% in less than 90 minutes.
*UNLOCKED LTE my fastest speed test was 89 Mbps on cellular network and with Dual sim trays you can easily configure it for 2 lines or one sim for data & 1 sim for calls. Even 2 carriers at once  At&T and the other T mobile.(Sweet)
*Build is Solid aluminum and quality buttons and one of the fastest fingerprint sensor of any phone.
*Screen being only 1080P is bright with good color reproduction and comes with a screen protector already applied.
*Octa- Core  makes it very snappy and I could not get it to shudder once with only 2gb ram is impressive performance.
*EMUI I heard many tech reviewers complaining about it and the app tray issue. I installed google launcher it takes 5 seconds to fix and I have to say I  love the Emui its packed with so many useful features that are all disabled so its not bloatware using up ram.
*Best phone Audio I have ever heard. I tried with all my sets and WOW blown away. Bose,Beats,Skullcandy,LG,Sony,Klipsch,Sennheiser & Kef.

Cons:
* Have to order all cases online
* Screen could be brighter.
* Android M update seems a waste to have all this power with older android.","5.0 out of 5 stars"

I am careful to close apps after I am done using them so as not to slow down the system. I primarily use it for email, camera, phoning and texting, and internet browsing.

8mm. I actually like the little extra thickness. The flat sides allow more contact with my thumb when holding it.

I've intentionally waited to write a review so that I'd have time to really get to know the phone, and provide as honest a review as possible.

To begin with, I'd consider myself an average smartphone user.  I make a few calls a day, text/WhatsApp/Skype quite a bit, search Google regularly, read books on Kindle app, watch Youtube/Netflix/HBOGo often, check Facebook and Snapchat a couple times a day, do some banking, read news/sports/stocks, listen to music/podcasts (through headphones or bluetooth speaker), occasionally snap a photo or video, and of course use various other apps at any given time.  Also, I travel quite a bit, so having an unlocked phone is something very important to me.

That being said, and to my relief and joy, I'm yet to find this phone wanting!  The UI is snappy and responsive and (if you're okay with iOS-like functionality) quite pleasant to use. The screen resolution at 1080p is fantastic!  My wife has an iPhone 6s Plus and we often place our screens side by side playing HD video to compare.  Our verdict is that is image qualities are equal -  a win for the 5X given the price disparity between the two phones!

Another feature that makes this phone particularly outstanding is the fingerprint sensor.  It's perfectly placed on the back of the phone so that I can unlock the phone, and control the notifications panel as I pull it out of my pocket, without ever having to touch the screen.  The convenience of it is a pleasant surprise, and I feel really sets this phone apart from other comparable phones like the Blue Vivo 5 (which I was also considering purchasing).

The few cons:  The camera is a bit weak in low light, but for my casual purposes at 13mp in back, and 5mp in front it works great.  Also, though I don't do any 3D gaming myself, I've heard that the picture lags when trying to play graphics intensive games.

TIP FOR A NICE SETUP
I bought my Honor 5x along with:
1) SPARIN 2 pack clear case- you gotta have a case.  This one's nice because it doesn't add much bulk to the phone and shows off the beautiful metal body build.
2) A Samsung 32gb microSD- the 5X comes with 16gb internal storage, so it's nice to add a bunch of extra space with a $10 microSD.
3) An OMOTON 2 pack screen protector- the screen protector that comes on the phone gets the job done, but isn't smudge resistant.  The OMOTON's are super oleophobic and keep the screen crystal clear and sharp looking.
4) A cricket SIM card- it's much cheaper to buy any phone provider's SIM online, and you can also avoid the activation fees by activating online too.

Overall I think the value packed into this phone can't be beat.  I've enjoyed it so much that we even bought one for my mother in law who loves her's as well.  In the end we got 2 Honor 5X's and all the accessories I mentioned above for a grand total of $445, nearly half the price of an unlocked iPhone 6s.  Needless to say,  this phone is a steal of a deal for any average smartphone user.

The true test will be if this feature packed yet inexpensive smartphone can withstand the test of time.  For that reason I'll be updating my review after 6 months, and 1 year of use.  For now I'm enjoying the Honor 5X thoroughly, and would absolutely recommend it to any value minded shopper!","5.0 out of 5 stars"

The Huawei Honor 5x is the first of its kind. It’s not a game changer in terms of the latest and the greatest. It’s a game changer in that it’s the first ‘real’ low cost phone that has a metal body, large battery, beautiful screen, fingerprint reader, decent cameras, and a decent processor.
For the longest time, phone makers reserved metal smartphones and fingerprint readers for their ‘flagship’ models. Only those who pay $600+ (un-subsidized) would have the luxury of accessing those new features. The Huawei Honor 5x was designed to disrupt that philosophy.

For reference, my previous phones were:
Nexus 5
Oneplus One
Oneplus Two
Nexus 5x

VALUE
At a very low $200 price point at launch, the Honor 5x is currently one of the best values in terms of specs, features, build material and support. To get to that price point, Huawei had to cut back on a few things like NFC, a faster processor and a camera quality. This may sound like a huge deal breaker, and it may as well be if you’re coming from a flagship phone from any other maker, but at $200, what the Honor 5x is able to pack into the phone is way better than any other phone in that same price range. (Name a metal high quality phone with a fingerprint reader that can be purchased at $200 at launch day. 02/05/2016)

SPEED
***Update 02/19/2016 After nearly 20 days using this phone as my primary phone, I'm finally ready to comment on the performance. Comparing the Honor 5x with my previous phone, the Nexus 5x, I would have to say that they seem identical. I actually haven't notice any significant lag on the Honor 5x whereas with my Nexus 5x, I've notice significant lag with similar apps. Just as a disclosure, I do not play mobile games much so I can't vouch whether this phone would be great for gaming. ***

FINGERPRINT READER
The Honor 5x’s fingerprint reader is pretty snappy. I can and probably will say that it’s quicker than the Nexus 5x’s fingerprint reader. Every time I’ve used it to unlock the phone, it’s done so smoothly and without any issues. What’s neat about their fingerprint software is that they’ll allow you assign specific privacy settings or actions per finger. An example is that I have set my left hand middle finger to unlock the phone in Guest Mode. This will hide all the apps I would prefer to be private (ie. Amazon, whatsapp, tinder, okcupid, etc). What I have noticed though is that when opening up in ‘Guest Mode’, the apps that are marked private will be viewable for a second before they disappear. This may be the limitation of the processor or maybe the coding in the software. Hopefully this is something that can be updated in future updates.

CAMERA
The Honor 5x’s camera isn’t the best in low light. So far a majority of my shots has been indoors of my dog and food, and I’ve found that the images look a bit dull. The camera is quick. Quicker than the Nexus 5x camera, but I don’t think it’s as vivid as it could be in low light.

ALUMINUM METAL BODY
The most noticeable feature of the Honor 5x would have to be the metal body. Huawei used quality build materials for this phone and it shows. It feels and looks like a premium phone.

3000mAh BATTERY LIFE
The battery life on the Honor 5x is forever. It has a larger battery than the iPhone 6S Plus which says a thing or two about a thing or two. So going 1.5 days of casual use without charging is doable. The only real downside is that the phone doesn’t utilize quick charging. I suppose you’ll rarely need it with a battery this size, but most people these days have power anxiety whenever they see a phone with less than 50%. Granted for the Honor 5x, 50% will last at least another half day, it’s oddly comforting to know that the phone is floating around 80-100% power.

BLOATWEAR
My biggest and only real complaint about this phone is Huawei’s Launcher EMUI. It’s heavy and full of apps and junk I prefer not to have. It’s as if Huawei was targeting price conscious iPhone users who would be willing to make the switch. It’s not a deal breaker for me as I know someone will eventually find a way to load pure Android onto the phone. In the meantime, I would RECOMMEND anybody who purchases this to download the Google Now Launcher or any other launcher. This won't completely mask the Huawei's feature, but it'll make the phone more manageable. I have yet to experience any significant lag with the Google Now Launcher with this phone.

RECOMMENDATIONS
1. Would I recommend this phone?  Most definitely
2. Would I recommend it to everybody?  Probably not. If you’re coming from a faster flagship phone, I would tell you to keep your phone.
3. Who is this phone for?  This phone is an easy upgrade for any android user who hasn’t upgraded their phone in the last year. Those who are okay with having a second or third tiered phone. Those who are looking for the ‘bang for their buck’. The Huawei Honor 5x is a game changer in terms of value.

You could remove the screen protector and put one on made of tempered glass if you are drivin nuts by the fingerprints, however I'm not sure how much a difference that would make and it takes skill to put one on and get it on properly. They do have them available and I almost bought a pack of 2 that the same company that I bought the Clear TPU case from. The TPU case actually came in a pack of 2 and fits the phone perfectly like glove...I didn't want to scratch the back metal and the case is clear...looks great on the phone..not sure why they send you two buy heck for $8 bucks who complaining search for the Honor 5X case by Sparin.  I think I'll order their screen protector as well and have someone do it that is better than I am at applying those. Sound quality is great the speaker is loud people say I sound very clear as do they. I am with T-mobile 4G LTE is flawless. Very happy with this purchase proves you don't have to shell out $800 for a quality device. Would I buy it again?...in a heartbeat!","5.0 out of 5 stars"

You guys shipped the phone in it's original box and then packaged it in another box...nice! Finger print scanner is very quick and once learned, keeps reading print every time you use it. It keeps getting quicker after first learned. Great screen, good battery life, nice fit and finish and call quality is nice. Some bloat ware can be removed, which is nice. Also has an honor community app installed! Nice! Just sign up and you can speak to the honor community and get any questions asked. Cant say I have seem that before on any other phone I've owned. Expandable storage is nice and it has honors own app cleaner installed in the settings menu. Far better than any other 3 rd party app out on play store. U.I. is heavily skinned with no app drawer but installing Nova, ADP or Google launcher easily sloves that problem. $200 bucks!?!? Its a no brained, get it.

Love the finger print reader you can save up to 5 finger to do some things on phone. Like unlock, open apps, or call someone. I bought two of them, and will not suggest to update the software I had a sound problem onece you were making a hands fre call, but i could figure out how to solve. After I did the update from Firmware_KIW-L24_C567B130 To KIW-L24 C567B140. I started to have audio problems. Placing calls on hands free ( when in call and press the mic icon) the sound came in distorted. I went online and found no solution the only thing i did is downgrade to Firmware_KIW-L24_C567B130 and problem was solved. Once again I own two Honer 5X and I downgrade one and solved the problem. The other one that has the 140 version has the problem and the downgrade to 130 to fix. Hopes this helps. O and a side note i was using different carriers on the two phones at&T and T-Mobile. So it is not carrier related.

For the money its excellent. I did use google now launcher as the stock is kind of hard to get use to it. Camera is good with good light has some problems at night and pictures will come out with some grains, but its OK a phone should no be used to take quality pictures its excellent for social networking.

Great to be used on At&t and specially on T-mobile which i am using mine, my wife is on At&t.

Battery is excellent and holds up great.

Can make calls with ether one sim card or the other it will show you when you are making a call

Update.
Another buyer asked if you could use tethering,
You can use tethering with T-mobile network. I do it with no problems.","5.0 out of 5 stars"

And now the icing on the cake... Huawei/Honor managed to squeeze a very nice aluminum unibody type casing,a very fast fingerprint reader,8core processing, and a FULL HD 1080p display all for right at $200 USD and that's a very impressive feat!

The speaker on this phone isn't as loud as my previous Samsung galaxy note 2 BUT it overall sounds better and it's loud enough, doesn't feel or sound cheap.
The all metal body is smooth and cool to the touch, The phone barely gets warm, its great design keeps it cool even under extreme operating conditions.
This is the best phone that ive had the pleasure of using PERIOD. The camera isnt bad either infact the detail pops and pics look very vibrant.
I see a lot of complaints around the internet about the emotion user interface, I rather like it, I haven't had any significant slowdowns and the ui helps make this phone stand out among all other android phones... I LIKE THE EMOTION UI BETTER THEN TOUCH WIZ AND I WILL NEVER GO BACK! It's a Honor to own your device. Great job!

Now for starters switching from an iPhone 5s to this the number one obstacle was the screen size but it went a lot smoother than one would think easier for me since I have larger hands but my wife who does not got used to it relatively quickly. Second obstical was the OS, EMUI hate it or love it was the perfect skin for previous iPhone users to get accustomed to, with no lag in sight.

Cameras: The rear facing camera on this device is excellent in good light and so so in low light but good none the less (see attached photos) front facing camera is nothing to write home about but it does what it is intended to do. Note the default 13mp for the rear is 4:3 and to get 16:9 you'll have to switch to the 10mp option.

Screen: The screen on this phone is excellent, gets bright when you need it to and gets dim when you need it to. And at 1080x1920 (1920x1080) media consumption is great. Color reproduction is also very nice for this ips display. Also a screen protector comes pre-installed so that's another thing I don't have to think about.

Call quality / earphone: on AT&T's network I've had great call quality with no dropped calls and good signal wherever I go (Southwestern Ohio) The earphone is also great getting a little too loud at some times. The speakerphone also gets loud but in the car and with loud toddlers (which I have) it probably isn't up to snuff. Callers also said that they could hear me very well on the other end with no choppiness or static.

Battery: in my opinion this is the best quality of this device I've gone two days before charging the device with moderate use but you will no doubt get a full day of heavy use. This to me is a reason alone to buy coming from and iPhone where I had to charge mid afternoon to make it through the day.

Storage: 16gb internal after OS and the usual apps from Google and huawei leaves you at around 10ish gb, but this is where the micro SD slot comes into play with support of up to 128gb making storage a not issue.

Fingerprint scanner: easy and fast setup and works perfectly every time. Also there are helpful things that you can do with it in regards to pulling down notifications, front back and many others that I haven't gotten into.

Build quality: on par with my old iPhone and feels great in the hand no problems here.

For $200 do yourself a favor and get this phone if you are in the market you can't go wrong.","5.0 out of 5 stars"

I have never used android before, but I immediately fall in love with the system. It's just so much fun to play around with it, and the app selections are also dramatically larger in google playstore. The system runs smoothly. The screen is crystal clear. I was kinda worried about the battery since the screen is larger and have heard that android can drain power faster. So far, I would have to say the battery is non issue and with light use (but with bluetooth/wifi on). It can last for 2-3 days. This is amazing, cause my iphone 5 sometimes couldn't even get through the day.

Overall very solid phone, and I am loving it!

Google voice was horrible and I really need something I can use as a 'phablet' due to needing to access electronic medical records while seeing patients and other documents.  I finally decided on this phone after many hours of researching specs, reviews, cost, and comparisons.  Many of the reviews I read from other amazon shoppers tipped the scale for me to choose this one.  I ordered it this morning around 10am and had FREE same day shipping.  At 6:06pm the phone was delivered to me!  I use phones until they no longer work not just because I want the newest item.  I have tried several different dual sim phones that I quickly returned which included a Blu phone.  I am thrilled so far with this phone!

I needed a phone with dual sims AND expandable memory, which the P8 did not have, you had to choose dual sims or extra memory via MicroSD.  This phone is so much better than the P8 Lite.  It is much more responsive with much less lag.  The screen and overall build of the device is also tightened up and feels better.  The larger screen takes some getting used to, but isn't too big and having a larger battery is the most beneficial part of the Honor 5x.  It would be more ideal if internal storage was 32GB, since you can fill up the 16GB pretty quickly even with the additional MicroSD card since you can't move all apps to the additional storage.  I am hoping that the Marshmallow update is release and allows extension of the internal storage to avoid this issue. The fingerprint reader is also very convenient, it is super fast and the gesture support is also handy using it to control items.  It also has double tap to wake which I missed from my Nokia Windows Phone days, it makes turning it on very handy when on a table.  I wasn't aware it came with a screen protector installed, but it is pretty nice, not like the latest glass protectors, but good enough to start.  I honestly don't have anything bad to say about this device, it meets all my needs and performs elegantly, bravo to Huawei building such nice devices at reasonable price points.  I know the camera isn't the greatest, but it gets the job done at the price point and isn't my main use of the device.  Newer models have better cameras if you are interested in that area.

I'm not a China brand product person at all, I had always been HTC fan for over 8 years.  Why did I switch?
1. Fingerprint sensors on the back of the phone
2. Price of the phone (No need to buy insurance for this phone, if you break it, you won't feel a thing to pay for another at $199)
3. Presentation of the phone
4. Speed of the phone at this $199 price
5. Battery lift is so crazy good (one full charge can last me the whole day, the lowest I got to was 9% left over when I got home)
6. External memory is something that can keep the speed of the phone to continuously been fast after so many photos stored in the memory card.
7. Dual phone sim is great if you are ever going to be on business trip out of the country.
8. Phone is Unlocked!!!!!!

A budget phone that costs $200 and a ""flagship killer"". I give it 5 stars for the former and 4 stars for the later. I am a nexus fan, own Nexus 4, 5, 7, 9 so you can see I will definitely not be biased against it in any way. And I am coming from an LG G2.

I bought this for me and nexus 6 for my wife both around the same time. Nexus 6, being last season's flagship phone and a phone that still tops many charts in performance will be my frame of reference here. Both devices has been selling really good on amazon with similar price range and great sales recently. So here it goes. Which device you should get?

Motorola Nexus 6 vs Huawei Honor 5X

Package, accessories and boxing

Both come with neat boxes but nothing fancy. Both come with warranty and manuals (despite some reviews mentioning the honor 5 coming without them) and sim ejection tool. the big difference here being the charger. The honor device comes with extremely generic charger, pretty slow at that too (1 amp, although it performs at slower rate than other similarly advertised ones). The Motorola device comes with quick charger (2 amps, goes from 10% to 100% in about 70 min, compared to 2.5-3 hours). Also note that it is much, much easier to find third party accessories for the nexus 6 on amazon and elsewhere (it has been around for longer after all)
Winner: Nexus 6

Set up
Both are android devices so a lot is common here. Both take advantage of the back up / restore function from google pretty well. Surprisingly, boot up and restoring apps and settings from the honor was faster by a good margin than the nexus 6 (35 min vs 50 mins). This has to do with the multiple updates the nexus 6 has to do before you reach the Android 6.0.1 it is supposed to reach. My honor came with Android 5.1.1 out of box. Restart time for the Honor was also surprisingly better than the nexus by few seconds. I would have to given this to the honor 5x
Winner: Honor 5x

Processor, RAM and Performance
Looking merely at numbers, nexus 6 wins, hands down. Snapdragon 805, 3 GB RAM, Adreno 420 GPU and pure Android experience. This translates into a very buttery performance. This thing is a beast! no lags whatsoever. It goes through apps with not even the slightest hiccup. 3D games looks amazing there. Although you may see benchmark tests slightly higher for other flagships from this year, I highly doubt you could observe the difference with naked eye.
The Honor 5X is mid range at best compared to that. Snapdragon 615, 2 GB of RAM are no match to that beats of a device. However, and this is a big however, since you are looking in this price range I assume you are looking for day to day device not a gaming moster. The honor X5 is plenty adequate for that. You may see the occasional hiccups here or there (so far, mostly with Google Play Store) but this is by no means an issue.
Overall, the Nexus performed better. However being a flagship device and a nexus device, this is expected. The pleasant surprise was the Honor 5x, despite having an inferior CPU, GPU and RAMS and a heavier EMUI skin, still performs very close to the nexus. I will have to give this one to the Honor because of that.
One downside I did not like in the Honor 5x is the lack of dual band WiFi. Now unless you have an internet line with speeds exceeding 10-15 M you should be fine.
On downside in the nexus 6 was the lack of an LED light for notifications. It is there as a hardware but you will have to root your device to control it. Not cool.
The killer addition on the honor was the finger print scanner. Spot on and no different in performance than what you find in Apple devices or the higher end nexus 6p. Kudos!
Honor 5x also has some nice features I missed from my LG G2 like tapping screen twice to wake up and flipping phone to mute alarm or ring. Those are missing from the Nexus 6.
Winner: Honor 5x

Battery
The honor 5x seems to take the edge clearly here as well. Despite having the EMUI skin and the older android version, I managed to get about 6-7 hours of screen on time. This is was only 3-4 on the nexus 6. Sure the nexus battery is larger but the higher pixel and stronger CPU are much more power hungry.
Winner: Honor 5x

Design and quality
Honor 5x wins here as well. Metal build is no means a $600 apple iphone but is a nice tough, and looks sturdier than the plastic covered nexus 6. Both are nice but the honor 5x is more likely to be mistaken for a $600 device than the nexus. Also I did not like the curved back on the nexus. It CAN NOT stay still on its back, very annoying if you try to open the device or text while on the desk or ground for example.
Winner: Honor 5x

Software
I am a nexus fan so here pure android, like it is meant to be, is the winner. Do not get me wrong though, EMUI is much less troublesome than I expected, and has some nice features.
Winner: Nexus 6

Display
On paper, the nexus 6 wins. More pixels, larger and better coating (Corning Gorilla Glass 3, lacking in Honor 5x). However the screen colors were by no means as lively as the ones on the Honor 5x. I think it is a tie.
Winner: Tie.

Value for Money
Around back Friday the nexus 6 was selling for $200. Recently it was around $250. Around that price I would have given the edge to the it. But It its current price ($350) the Honor 5x wins.
Winner: 5x

Camera
Both cameras are pretty comparable. The Honor 5x default app has more features but this is android! You can just download any app/feature at the touch of a bottom. Both have lacking cameras in poorly let environments. I think the Honor 5x has a slight advantage but overall I would call it a tie.
Winner: Tie

Overall, being a hardcore nexus fan, I find it very hard to say but the Honor 5x has my vote. Huwaei seemed to have found it is way to the use market with just the right combination of performance, price and features. Cannot wait to get their Nexus 6p which based on what I saw in this Honor device, should be a incredible!","5.0 out of 5 stars"

However, if you have active kids that you love to take pictures of this is definitely not the phone for you. I tried several outside this afternoon while the kids were playing in the yard. All of them came out blurry. Outside. Sun shining. That being said, the rest of the phone is very nice. Build quality is great. Fingerprint scanner works amazingly well and pretty quick. Much better than the one on my Note 5. OS runs smooth with no noticeable lag. There are many options to tweak outside of the typical Android ones. There is no app drawer, which may throw some people. The skin is very similar to iOS. However, install any of the many launchers available from Google Play and your app drawer will be available. All in all, for $200, this phone is hard not to like. However, for $220 you can get a waterproof Moto G that has a better camera (IMHO) and timely updates (at least to Marshmallow... After that, who knows???). It's hard to go wrong with either.

PROS
-Price
-Fingerprint Scanner works great!
-Dual Sim
-Expandable Memory
-Likable Skin with some original useful features / options
-No noticeable lag

Cons
-Camera
-No NFC (not that important to me, but might be to some)
-No 5 gHZ Wi-Fi (not that important to me, but might be to some)
-No quick charging or wireless charging
-Updates, while promised, are not guaranteed. Stuck on Lollipop at the moment
-Skin is usable, nice, with great features and options. However, it is lacking an app drawer
-Display seems a bit washed out","3.0 out of 5 stars"

For me personally, the most impressive feature for this budget smart phone is the fingerprint sensor.  The fingerprint sensor is very accurate and responsive (once you calibrated it).  I can turn on my phone and unlock it at the same time with one finger touch on the fingerprint sensor and in less than a second the phone is on and unlocked.  The elegant design (with metal/aluminum body) and crisp LCD screen are the other reasons I also like this phone. The slow motion video recording is also really nice feature.  This phone also has dual sim capability which is very useful and convenient if you travel internationally or if you have two phone numbers such as personal and business number. This phone 16GB storage is expandable with microSD (which is my main dissatisfaction with iPhone that iPhone internal storage can't be expanded). This Honor 5X phone is also unlocked so you can use it with your existing carrier (e.g. AT&T, Verizon, T-Mobile, etc). This phone has 2GB RAM which is good enough to run multiple apps and play games (clash of clans, domination, etc).  This Honor 5X phone reminded me of Blue Life One X and also the Oneplus One+ phone. All in all Honor 5X is a great budget smartphone.","5.0 out of 5 stars"

Comparative with respect to the phones I previously had, a Huawei Ascend mate (stoled) and a Ulefone Be Touch, a Chinese low-cost (but powerful on the paper) that I bought when my Huawei got stolen and didn't want to spend too much.
I think that it is important to introduce it, as in reality each review is based on the reviewer previous experience.
Now, let me just anticipate the conclusions: this is a great phone, which only downside are minor delays in opening apps or running heavy apps.
I have read almost all the reviews available online before buying the phone, so here some info you'll not find on them:
- the FINGERPRINT really works. This is not always the true for all the phones. The Ulefone Be Touch one was crap, although it may had to do with the position: while less practical, being the scanner on the back you always touch it with the finger on the same angle. Conversely, on the Be Touch the fingerprint is on the top, and you may touch it with your finger using a wider case of angles. And trust me, you'll need a fingerprint scanner if your phone is stolen and you don't want to give people free access to all your digital world (and no.. password or pattern are so slow that you'll end up disabling them)
- the 5.5 inches SCREEN includes the buttons sidebar on the bottom, so it's not so big really. In other phones you have a true 5.5 inches display PLUS the capacitive buttons on the bottom. The screen looks nice - clear and bright-, but almost all screens nowadays are nice to me (with the exception of 800x640 pixels screen in the cheapest 10 inches tablets), so no real point here.
-  while there is a very heterogeneous opinions on the quality of the CAMERA, I found it to make somehow less nice photos than the Ulefone ones, of course in low-light conditions (I am not a photographer, and to me all outdoor photos seems the same). You can get a bit of funny in discovering the meaning of ""beauty"" for asians using the ""beauty mode""
- the PROCESSOR unfortunately is a bit crap. Yes, all works.. but it takes a few seconds for apps to open, and for heavy apps like OsmAnd (an open source GPS navigator that draws on the map ton of polygons by default) you can really see the difference, even with the cheap Ulefone that here ""wins"". It also warms a bit.. not really ""hot"" and pretty comfortable in February to warm your hands in the pocket, but maybe in the summer I'm going to hate it!
- the SOFTWARE layer that Huawei adds on top of Android.. maybe I am the only one but I like it. I mean, I like playing with something a little bit different. I found it nice and polish, and you have hundreds of themes to suit your taste (I recall a review that was complaining the icons have too large rounded corners.. it really depends from the theme, just select an other theme to have square/circle/whatever shape icons you want!) . Also an other complain is the missing of the app drawer selector.. but even for that, if you miss it, just download one from the Google Play Store (same for the home launcher).
- the BATTERY seems to work well, but it's only a few days I have the phone, and it's too early to express an opinion for it;
- the RADIO signal /call quality and stability is great. Really, that's the reason I bought this phone after the experience with the Ascend Mate (+) and the Ulephone Be Touch (-----), and not e.g. the Xiaomi Redmi Note 3 that on the paper seems more powerful. After all, this is a **mobile** so if the radio compartment is s., it makes the whole phone useless.
- the DESIGN is really really beautiful, but this is really subjective, so I left this as the last point.

Enjoy!","4.0 out of 5 stars"

They're actually the #3 smartphone manufacturer in the world but Americans haven't heard of them since they've never targeted the USA before.  So I'm telling you in advance, this company is like the Hyundai of the automotive market about a decade ago...they make amazing products and they're selling them dirt cheap to get our attention.

I also want to add up front that this is not a paid review, even though I'm going all willy-nilly over these phones.  I live out in the country where cell reception stinks on all carriers, so I started researching which phones received the best overall signal.  And surprisingly enough, everyone from CNet to TechCrunch was saying this company named Huawei was getting like double the download speeds compared to every other phone out there.  So I bought two of these for my daughters hoping for a decent budget phone...but what I got easily rivals all but the top premium phones on the market today.

What do I mean by that?  For starters, my wife has a Galaxy 6 and I have an HTC One M9...both solid, newer phones, right?  Well, my wife gets download speeds of 10-15 mb/s in the house and I get slightly worse.  Yet the kids are downloading at 25-30 mb/s on their $200 no-name phones from Huawei?  That alone makes them a steal.

But once you look a little closer, you'll see that these phones have awesome battery life, true 1080i screens, very solid cameras (slightly worse than my wife's Galaxy, about the same as my M9) and amazing charging times thanks to the new C connectors.  Additionally, the rear fingerprint scanner just kicks butt and takes names....once you get used to it, you'll almost never swipe the screen or enter passwords anymore.

There are a few downsides, like only 16G of on-board memory, but a $30 micro SD card solves that and you're good to go.  Also, people complain about the Huawei interface but that's because they really don't give it a fair chance.....it has ridiculous amounts of customization options to really make this phone your own.  The lack of an app drawer was the one thing that worried me, but my teens don't seem to miss it at all.  They're too busy downloading stuff at blazing speeds to let that bother them.

In summary, this should EASILY be a $500 phone in the US market and the fast, responsive processor will put most to shame.  Seriously folks, this is a six star (out of five) purchase and I am absolutely in love with these devices.  Compared to phones like the Galaxy Prime and others in the $200 range, there is simply no comparison at all.","5.0 out of 5 stars"

I'd Like To Give It 4.5 stars, but will rate up because of the price. It's not a perfect phone, and this review may sound more negative than a 5 star rating. But if you are going to buy the phone, you should understand the limitations that come with the price. And knowing what I do now, I'd still buy it.

I didn't want to review the phone until I used it for a while, and since I've had it a few months, it's time. After reading some reviews here I installed the Google Now Launcher over the Huawei EMUI. That's gone pretty well, but twice it reverted back to the Huawei Home Launcher. It is easy enough to fix, but I forgot how, so each time it took about a half hour to figure out. Answering the phone is also a bit tricky. The icons are not intuitive, and as a result I've missed many calls. Just when I thought I understood it, the icons changed again.

Anyhow, there's much to like about the Honor 5X. The fingerprint reader is sweet, although if my hands are a little wet (touching a water glass) it doesn't read right away. And when you reboot, you need to enter your PIN. I'm not sure I understand that logic but it's not a big deal. I like the size of the phone, and it feels solid.

The home, back and open apps buttons are part of the screen. In my last phone it was below the screen, and I think I like that better. With one game, I can't access those buttons because the game is using the entire screen.

The camera is good, not great, and better with daylight than indoor light.

People here like the battery life but I haven't found it to be that good. Over the weekend I went to Washington DC with a fully charged phone. In 5 hours I sent a few text messages, took about 8 photos, posted to Facebook 7 times, did about 6 web searches and used the map twice, each time for about a minute. Total time using the phone maybe 20 minutes. And that took me down to 78%.

Not perfect. But for the price, it's very good.","5.0 out of 5 stars"

If you like organizing everything and customizing this phone is great for that. It has three is on theme sets, I'm using the second one. You can customize the transition of your screens. I've been using the fingerprint for most navigation and it is VERY sensitive. Sometimes I forget the sensor is there and end up closing an app. Its as heavy as my Hubby's LG V10, and in my opinion almost as nice. The camera on back has great reso and its very fast. You can use the fingerprint sensor to capture photos and change how many seconds you have to hold the sensor. The front facing camera seems gritty to me, in low light, but perfect in bright locations. I've noticed my phone gets pretty warm when I'm in a warmer environment. So when I play my games and its warm as all get out in my house, my phone is hot hot hot. It charges fairly quickly. The battery last me all day but I have to say the battery percentage indicator seems a little wishy-washy. I've unplugged my phone a few times and went on Instagram/Facebook/buzzfeed for 30 minutes or less and it says it drains to 95-90% but I have at least 20% at the end of the day when I use it most.

Definitely reccomend the phone... It feels solid, works great, and does what I need it to do. I'm not a blogger or anything so my cameras don't need 18937 mp to make me satisfied with what they're used for.

I do think the micro sim and nano sim/microsd card holders could be less dramatic. I thought I broke it when I had to force the little thingy down to open it.","4.0 out of 5 stars"

right now, although I will say, that this phone does NOT feel like a mid-range, but more like a ""Flagship.""
With the specs that this phone comes with, one would very easily think that this phone would cost between
$600-$700 easy. But if I were to tell you that this phone was only $199, you would look at me like as if I
had three heads! Think of it for a sec, what $199 mid-range phone would come with specs like:
a 1.5 GHZ Octa-core processor, a screen resolution of 1080-1920p (401 for the ppi patrol,) an Adreno 405
CPU, 16GB ROM, 2GB RAM, 2 micro card trays, for dual sim cards and a micro SD card up to 128GB,
a 13  mega-pixel rear facing camera, and a 5 mega-pixel front facing camera for great selfie shots, a
3000 mAh battery, a 5.5 inch HD screen, and an overall gorgeous, colorful, HD screen.
It is a true statement that the camera does take excellent pictures when outside, but it's not as good in
low light areas. So, as common as this may sound, if you want at least a decent low-light picture, use the
flash in those darkened areas. Believe me, it does do some justice to those types of pics in low light.
Overall, I can see this being somewhat of a so-called mid-range ""Flagship-Killer"" phone, but again, I will say, that for
a mid-range with these type of specs for a total price of $199, that is practically unheard of.","5.0 out of 5 stars"

I simply adore this phone. Huawei really knew what they were when they made this phone. The screen is so clear and I have received so many compliments on the screen and camera. It is much easier to take pictures of checks to make mobile deposits than it was on my Samsung. The front facing camera is also very clear and the settings only add more bang for your buck.

On the note of the processor and RAM, I just can't seem to slow this phone down no matter what I do. I'm not an avid phone gamer but I've had 7+ apps running and it still runs like a dream. 2 gigs of RAM is pretty standard and doesn't seem like much but I haven't overloaded it yet (it tells you how much is free in the recent apps menu).

Battery life is much better than my Samsung even though I constantly listened to music through Spotify on both, the 5X sports a 3000 mAh battery and has some nifty features where it will monitor and warn you about power intensive apps as well as manage processing power and brightness to lengthen the run time on a single charge. Never use optimize function though.

Fingerprint sensor is what attracted me so much to this phone other than price point as you really don't see this on phones priced at only $200. The reaction speed is very fast and convenient with the gestures feature and tasks that can be assigned be assigned to different fingers. My only problem is that it won't read your fingerprint if it is wet (I work in an environment where my hands are constantly in and out of water) and sometimes it doesn't read the finger correctly.

Finally, the UI. Doesn't have the latest Android OS but I honestly don't care. The Emotion UI gets a lot of flack from people and they immediately download a launcher to get an app drawer. I have had both an android (for phone calls) and Apple (Ipod Touch for music before I got Spotify) so I really like the mixing of Android and iOS in this UI and became acclimated very easily.

I love my new phone and hope that they bring high end phones as well to the US market because the Honor 7 has my name written all over it.","5.0 out of 5 stars"

The best mistake I've ever made.
Background: I currently have a Samsung S5, Nexus 6, Nexus 6P and this Honor 5X. First because I love the FP snanner on the 6P.
This scanner is better! It has functions for different  actions with the scanner. It also shows the progress of the initial scan, unlike the 6P. Although the 6P is still my regular phone.
But the Honor 5X destroys the Samsung.
I grew to hate the bloatware, lags and awful battery after owning many Samsung's.
Any phone that fully charged 109% at night and turned off to  95% is suspect.
The Honor 5X has great battery life, easy to use interface along with BOTH expandable memory and ability for 2 SIM cards is unbelievable. Plus it fits perfectly in the sleave for a Nexus 6P.

I was in the market for a new one as I dropped my Nexus 6 at work earlier in the week and cracked the screen.  Motorola wouldn't repair as the phone was registered in Grand Cayman (long story...Ebay purchase) and local repair shops wanted $250 because they wouldn't just replace the glass but the digitizer too.  So I didn't want to spend a whole lot of $ as I just purchased the Nexus 6 in October, 2015 and I like to upgrade my phone annually (out-of-pocket/unlocked w/T-mobile).  After debating between this, the LG Nexus 5x, and the Huawei Nexus 6p, I went with the Honor 5x.  Reviews were favorable and price was right.  I particularly liked the battery life, fingerprint scanner, and screen size/clarity.  The mixed reviews on the camera almost made me change my time.  So my personal impression after using the phone heavily for two full days is that it's well worth $200.  I have an iphone 6s through work and I actually prefer the look/feel of the Honor 5x, primarily due to a larger screen.  I switched to the Nova Launcher and now have app tray which I'm familiar with.  My biggest complaint about the phone is the wifi.  I downloaded an album via google play and it took about 15 minutes to download on wifi!  Wifi is molasses slow and I'm not sure why they chose to cut corners on such a critical experience on a mobile phone (update:  downloaded 2 more albums tonight and took about 10-15 mins for both...still slow but not as bad as first experience).  Outside of that, the camera actually takes nice pictures.  I haven't really tried it in low light situations which seems to be professional reviews main complaint with it.  It does have a lot of different modes to choose from (good food anyone?).  The strongest point to me is the battery.  Much better than the Nexus 6 which I love.  I'm weird about battery drain...when it gets below 50%, I need to put it on a charger.  The phone doesn't have quick charge capability but you will get a faster charge using a higher rated (amp) charger than the one that comes with the phone.  You should just toss that one in the trash unless you have no choice.  All the reviewers complaints about Huawei's software is overblown.  Get a launcher to overlay and you'll be fine.  Now Huawei, can you release 6.0 so we can catch up?  Not sure why the phone wasn't released with it but one of Motorola's biggest selling points is stock android operating system and quick software update releases.  Honor 5x doesn't have a stock android operating system which isn't a bad thing in my opinion but quick software updates would make Huawei an even stronger contender in the mobile cell phone market.  Recommend the phone as the pros far outweigh the cons.","5.0 out of 5 stars"

The display is vibrant and crisp, the larger screen size is great, and overall it has a stylish flagship feel and functionality at a reasonable price.

One thing to be aware of is the phone's custom UI. It's different from other Android phone UIs that I've used--specifically, its lack of the usual Android app drawer. It was strange at first, but I like grouping things into folders so I had no issue getting used to it (you can always download an alternate launcher like Nova if you prefer a drawer.) I also noticed a lot of people complaining about the UI being ugly, but honestly I like it. I prefer more ""minimalist"" UIs that don't have that beveled look.

It doesn't have a great processor, but it's not a bad one. This probably wouldn't be a phone for smooth upper level mobile gaming, namely games with 3D graphics in real time (ex. shooters.) However, it runs other games just fine. I play ""mobage"" games, which don't have too many 3D assets, and unlike my old phone, it runs them perfectly.

The fingerprint scanner is also a great plus. I didn't buy this phone for it and I didn't have much intention to use it, but I've grown attached to how convenient it is for unlocking my phone. I also have small hands, so touching the finger pad to take a photo is so much easier than trying to reach the on screen shutter button.

Anyway these are just my experiences with the phone thus far. If you're looking for a phone with a flagship feel without having to shell out big bucks, this one is definitely worth looking into.","5.0 out of 5 stars"

Pros:
Great screen, with a factory fitted screen protector on it, no bubbles.
Lovely metal back. Spoilt a bit by a small serial-number sticker.
Finger print sensor, that is fast for me. Never knew how nice it was to unlock using a finger on the back on the phone, and typing in my PIN is now a pain.
Huawei's own launcher/desktop EMUI that does not have an app draw. All your apps are on one of the screens. Don't like that, but otherwise fine. Has some nice hidden features. The launcher is a little laggy, closing some apps goes to a black screen then the background appears.
Fast and responsive, except for the phone dialer! Not sure why, but dialing phone numbers is very laggy, typing in the chrome browser is laggy too, but that may be chrome or the keyboard.
Comes with Huawei's own apps. Own web browser and email and camera. I use google's chrome browser, gmail, and camera from the app store.
4G LTE connects are great.
WiFi is very good, but now picks up all sorts of public networks my old phone didn't as the bus ride home passes hotels and hospitals. Phone tries to connect to them and switches out of 4GLTE, and i loose the internet.  I need wifi on for work and home, but don't want it auto connecting to other networks.
Great power use. Battery lasts me about 3 days, the Nexus4 lasted 0.8 of a day. Good battery monitoring and notifications. Good app control when the screen powers off.
Huaweis camera is fast, takes the picture the moment you press the button. Offers panorama and other camera extras. Googles camera is 2Meg per picture, Huawei's at the same resolution is 3Meg per picture.

Neutral:
Not the latest Android, one back, but fine.

Cons:
No clock app!?  You have to install a clock widget if you want to use the alarm clock or stop watch.
No airplane mode in the quick settings. Takes 5 swipes/clicks to get in/out of airplane mode.
Micro USB for charging
Only seems to have 2.4GHz wifi. No 5GHz wifi!?
No Gyroscope sensor, so googles camera does not offer photo sphere or panorama. Disappointing. Googles camera is slow, takes 0.5+++ seconds to refocus etc and take a picture.

Very happy with it overall. Great call quality, great screen, good camera, fast, lovely design, finger print unlock. Had to get a case as i was too worried about scratching it. The case changed the way i held it and had to re-train on my fingerprints. Can learn 5 sets, & it is quick to do.","5.0 out of 5 stars"

Crisp screen and detail, good camera (not GREAT, but very good in terms of the color and level of detail it captures).  Smooth interface, very intuitive.  Fast performance, comes with a solid amount of memory, the finish and feel of the phone feels nothing less than a phone that would cost 500+ dollars.  But it's not all in the looks, the phone runs and operates phenomenally - particularly considering that it's a $200 phone when all is said and done.  Can't go wrong.  Oh and the finger print scanner can be programmed for multiple fingers, not just for one finger print on one hand.  And you can make it do different functions like go to home screen, unlock, etc.  FAST response time.

The on screen buttons I prefer because it prevents me from reaching my thumb to the bottom of the phone when operating it with one hand which is usually how I end up dropping and breaking my large phones.  With the on screen button I don't have to shift over to the lowest point of the phone.","5.0 out of 5 stars"

Finger Print ID works out great. Fast and Quality Build. Comes with screen protector already which is a surprise. Dual Sim Card a Plus. Glad I bought it. Huawei managed to put a $199 price tag on it.

North America customers are hard to please, so they are shipping really good quality phones for us. If you need a good phone with a $200 budget, Don't hesitate. Forget about the overpriced Apple, Samsung, LG , SONY, Nokia phones. This is the ONE that will attract customers at all ages!  P.S. Huawei also have higher end units running from $299 and up. Only thing it does not have is the NFC ( If they add on that, they can't offer you that $199 price tag.

Just installed the first big update the other day and it went very smoothly. Bought this for my wife's birthday and was worried she'd be put off by the larger size but nope, she has never even mentioned it. Her previous phone was an Honor 3C and this one is better in every way. She is especially impressed by the battery life (YMMV of course).

Pros: 4G LTE. Large, bright, clear screen, 1080 x 1920 @ 400 ppi. Very nice. Decent cameras, good WiFi and Bluetooth performance, expandable memory, 3000 mAh battery last's her all day and then some unless she overuses it. Fingerprint scanner if you want to use one. One of our favorite features is the ability to light up the lock screen with a light double-tap, no need to touch a button (that option needs to be turned on in: Settings > Motion Control). I have a Galaxy S4 and I wish I could get my phone to do this. Is it a feature in Android 5.1 or a Huawei feature? Little in the way of bloatware.

Cons: No dual-band WiFi, 2.4 GHz band only. No top of the line processor but it's still faster than the Honor 3C and it's still peppy enough (for us anyway). I'm not a big fan of the Huawei user interface (EMUI 3.1) and if I could switch it off I would like to try stock Android, but it's not all that bad and it's the same as the UI on her Honor 3C so she was comfortable with it on day 1. Non-removable battery.

Speakerphone performance is OK and call quality is OK. It connects to the car's Bluetooth automatically (after initial setup) every time she gets in the car and works fine. Considering the $200. price tag this phone is a great value and so far we have nothing to complain about. Would buy again and would recommend it to others.","5.0 out of 5 stars"

Lemme start by pointing out that I was the biggest anti android guy in town. Started with the original iphone and have been apple apple apple up until my 6plus gave in to some deep water while cruising on the lake. My buddy convinced me that a sony z3 would be a good replacement and after to weeks of having one it broke,  totally my fault.  I bought this phone and let me tell you,  the camera literally blows my iphone cams out of the water. I've taken pics of my friends who are also die hard apple products and they literally say ''the phone takes really nice pictures''. Idk why the reviews don't point this out. And the smoothness of it is really making my android transition go really well desite the talk of android being laggy.  The fingerprint scanner is a tad better than my 6plus was because the placement of it is alot easier with the honer. I'm finding that android is ahead of apple as this 5x is just as easy to operate and the plus is you actually have options.  I may be riding on this android train for quite a while and the honor 5x is definitely a better phone than my 6plus more a fraction of the cost.","5.0 out of 5 stars"

I'm very, very pleased with it.  Is it ""perfect"", NO but it's far superior to the $500+ phones that AT&T sell and there is no bloatware on it.  All of the AT&T apps on my Play Store list, I just hit the ""X"" in the top right corner...and doing that felt really good.

The app's provided by Huawei for email, music, video are far better than anything you can find it the Google Play Store.
Double tap to wake up and provided Screen Lock app to turn off are very convenient.
Any apps that I didn't want and could not delete, I just disabled.

Things that I consider suggestions for improvement...
1.  it's sometimes a bit slow to redraw the screens but so what.
2.. the WiFi is not dual-band; it's 2.4GHz only.
3. not crazy about the default launcher because there is no way to hide/remove apps that you do not want on your desktop so you have to create a ""crap app folder"".  To solve this, I just applied the Google Now launcher which works perfectly...
4.  without installing a 3rd party glass screen, phone gets way too many fingerprints
5.  without using protective case, phone is too slippery to handle and the power button in located right where you grip the phone.  I would like to see the power button relocated to the top of the case.
6.  would like the 3 navigation buttons to be part of the phone hardware, not the android OS.  these buttons rotate with the screen which is a sometimes little awkward and confusing.
7.  when charging, phone displays a green light...i would like to see it red when charging and to turn green when fully charged.
8.  phone is slightly too big and too heavy...smaller and lighter would be better for my taste.

If Huawei offers a phone exactly like this one only with more RAM, a faster processor, 5GHz WiFi, and a little smaller screen would be nice but not if not still OK, count me in!  I'll buy it immediately but until they do, this phone is still tops on my list.

I am completely impressed with this phone. It feels much more expensive than what it costs and looks amazing, you won't be embarrassed of this phone in public I promise you. Now the metal back doesn't feel as premium as say the Iphone 6, but it doesn't cost as much either. It still feels very nice. I was afraid this phone would be to big but it really wasn't. I was coming from using an LG G2 which has a 5.2 inch screen. This phone is just a little taller but no wider than my G2 with a case on it. It surprised me by how compact it really was. Like i said taller, but no wider than my G2 was in it's a case. It has tons of features and settings and the fingerprint scanner is spot on.  Nice touch!!

  With all the settings it can seem a little overwhelming even with somebody like me who is used to android phones. The Honor UI is gonna take some getting used to without a doubt. First thing i done was install Action Launcher and it made the phone feel a little more like stock Android but there's just some things a launcher won't fix. All in all the Honor EMUI has some nice touches, I don't hate it. But like I said it has tons of settings for you to play with and figure out. My phone came with 54% battery and I set it up and downloaded all my apps and changed things to the way I wanted them and that took a little over 3 hours and the battery had 7% when i put it on the charger. So the battery seems like it's going to be great, which is what most of the reviews said that iv'e read. I haven't tested the camera other than a few quick shots just to make sure it worked. It doesn't have OIS though and that really sucks. It does have FM radio on it though. Honor also informed me that they was pushing out the first update for this device February the 15th maybe even a little before then. It's not the marshmallow update though, probably a security patch. It's nice to see them standing behind this product like they said they would. That's a good sign. Also i haven't had any lag what so ever. The phone is responsive and feels very fast. Not flagship fast but it's just as fast as my LG G2. I'm really happy with my purchase! If you're still thinking. go ahead and get this phone. You will love it! Nice build, fast fingerprint scanner with plenty tricks, fast and smooth during streaming and browsing and all for $200.00! You can not beat this phone at that price. It's impossible.

 UPDATE: (2/3/16) I just found out from HONOR that this phone is running the Snapdragon 616 not the 615!! Another plus! Sure enough I ran Antutu on my phone and it says Qualcomm Snapdragon 616 and scored around 34,000 to 36,000. Also this battery is a beast!! I got a little over 6 hours of on screen time with my phone being off the charger for over 20 hours! I am so happy with this phone. Also if you use a 5V/2A charger the phone will charge in about 2 hours. You're looking at over 3 hours if you use the charger that came with it. I just used my LG G2 charger as it was 5V/2A. Today was my first full day using the phone and i am extremely pleased with it so far. WIFI and Bluetooth worked perfectly and the sound through the headphones is really good. Has more bass than my old LG G2. Sounds good in my car through Bluetooth as well. Also on my LG G2 i constantly had around 2 bars of reception while indoor. NOT with the 5X. It must have a really strong antenna because right now my LG has 2 bars and the 5X has 4 bars! And they are sitting next to each other. That's another big win for Honor. The more bars you have the better the signal and the faster the LTE!

UPDATE: (2/8/16)  I had to return my first unit for a replacement because it felt like the bottom left side of the phone was coming separated also the screen was going bad, it had lines running through it. It was hard to see for the most part but using the Hello app it was really noticeable. I have already received my replacement and so far so good. It seems like it's put together and built the way it was meant to be in the first place. Also on the same Hello app there are no lines. Screen looks perfect. I'm so glad to because i completely love this phone so i was praying that my replacement would come and work perfectly and it did!! Also for anyone that needs to know how to move your photos and music and contacts among other stuff download the app SUPERBEAM. All you have to do is download it on both phones you want to send and receive with and presto! It's amazing, easy and free! It's super fast. Way faster than Blutooth and so simple. Try it out, trust me you will love it. I transfered  all my music (around 120) in about 7 to 8 minutes. It's the way to go with no NFC and faster than Blutooth. I LOVE MY HONOR 5X!!!!!!

UPDATE: (2-9-16)  I have Straight Talk and I'm unable to use the WiFi Hotspot. Every time I try it informs me to dial 611 from the phone which takes me to Straight Talk hotline. Just wanted to let all the Straight Talk users know that the WiFi Hotspot is basically useless unless someone knows someway around it. I don't. However my LTE speeds are awesome! I've been getting around 20 to 28 just about all the time! Never was able to get them speeds on my LG G2 unless I was outside. I'm getting these fast speeds in my house! I can not praise the antennas on this phone enough. They are top of the line!!

UPDATE: (2-11-16) Just thought I would let you guys know about a couple of tweaks I've used that seem to speed the phone up quite a bit. It does involve going into the developers options settings. If you're not sure how to get the dev settings all you do is go to about phone and tap on build number 5 or 6 times and it'll tell you that you're now a developer. Then back out to the settings and you should see developer options down by the about phone setting. Anyways I've enabled the Force GPU Rendering setting which may cost a little battery life but I'm not sure yet because I've just done it. I'll update if I notice any change in battery. But it seems to make the phone run so smooth. I've also changed all the animation settings that you will find in dev options to .5. This setting speeds up all the animations on the phone for a dramatically faster experience.
  So I Forced GPU Rendering and changed animation settings to .5 and my phone is running like a top!! Give it try and you'll see what I mean. I will update tomorrow about the GPU Rendering and if it does of doesn't eat more battery life. Until then those are the tricks I've tried for a better faster experience.
P.S. Don't go changing any of the other dev option settings unless you know what you're doing.

UPDATE: (2-12-16) So I've went through the day with the GPU rendering forced setting turned on in Dev options and it has not made any difference in my battery life. No better no worse but the phone is buttery smooth and with my animations on .5 it's twice as fast. I wish  I would have known about these tweaks with some of my older slower phones! Folks these tweaks work and I haven't noticed them interfering badly with the phone at all. So give it a try and you will see. Also I have played around with the camera now quite a bit and while I won't go into the settings of the camera right now the pictures it takes are middle of the road. In good lighting the pics are fine, as long as you don't hold the same pic next to a more expensive phone like Iphone 5 or 6 or an LG G3 or Samsung S6. The camera on this phone isn't even close to as good as the one on my LG G2. In low light the pics aren't that good at all. I have seen worse but the camera really struggles in low light. In good lighting though the pics are fine for social media and things such as that but don't get this phone if you want a great camera.I agree with most of the other reviewers of this phone about the camera. Good lighting equals decent pictures but low lighting is going to equal low quality pictures which actually isn't the case on more expensive phones. I have still took some decent pics with this phone though so it's not all bad. Also mediocre camera and all this is the best phone on the market right now in it's price range and even a little above it's price range. It's just a great phone and anyone that says otherwise must have got a dud or just don't know a good phone when they see or use one. For this price there isn't a better phone in the American market. If you have any ?s for me leave them in the comment section and i'll try to help answer any of your ?s that i can. Thanks for reading my review. I will still be making updates as I go along using this phone.

UPDATE: (2-23-16) Today the phone received a software update. Although it isn't the marshmallow update it does include January's security patch and improvements. I haven't really noticed anything different since the update other than the January security patch. It's still nice to see them update the phone in a timely manner. My LG G2 is still on Decembers security patch. If  they push a MM update out in a timely manner they will be winners in my book because they did what they said they would do, which a lot of phone companies do not.

UPDATE (3-3-16) So I'm still loving my phone. I've got the window animations set to .5 and the force GPU rendering option turned on in developer settings and this phone is really fast! I'm super satisfied with this purchase. I've also noticed im getting so much better battery life with the GPU rendering turned on. If you haven't turned it on try it, you don't know what you're missing. It makes the phone buttery smooth. If you're still thinking of buying this phone go ahead and get it, do yourself a favor, you won't be disappointed!

UPDATE (3-10-16)  Today I just achieved  5 hr. 15 min. of on screen time while my phone had been off the charger for 17 hr. 15 min.!!!! Still had 3% battery left! That is impressive. The battery on this phone continues to please me. I never worry about a mid-day charge. And that's with my screen brightness set on 68%! Just yet another reason for you to BUY this phone! I have also noticed that if I am out in the bright sun the text on the phone intensifies so I can see it better! You do have to turn that feature on in the settings though. So many nice features on this phone. I'm still finding out new things that this phone can do. Best phone I have had to date.

UPDATE (3-11-16) HONOR is now accepting beta testers for the Marshmallow update! You can go to the Honor Community page to sign up if you would like to test the new update before it is released to the public. I've already signed up. Better hurry though, it's first come first serve! Honor is making good on their word of updating this phone in a timely manner. It makes you feel good knowing a company is doing what they said they would. I can't wait for Marshmallow!","5.0 out of 5 stars"

I had seen an Alcatel for $250 at Walmart that looked decent, but the Honor 5x came up when I google for best budget phones 2016 and I am so happy I ordered the Honor 5x.
I was impressed with the quality and performance of this phone. The perfect alternative to an iphone 6 plus. I was trying to get the 3gb version for $25-40 more, even thought about bumping up to the Honor 7,  which is more than twice as much, but I am glad I did none. The 2gb version works excellent.
I paid $10 for same day instead of opting for free shipping. I ordered at 11pm Saturday, received it 9am Sunday. Wow!

Update 3/31/2016
It's been about 3 months. I purchased a second Honor 5x today. I ordered during breakfast, and arrived by 5pm, how can you go wrong with same day delivery for $10?

After owning 2 Different Samsung phones in a short period of time, the G2 stayed until now for a reason.  It was a great phone.  So when I started to look for a replacement, I was looking for a couple of features I didn't want to do away with, which I found here, and SO many more!

I also bought a  Motorola Moto X Pure first, then this.  The screen on this phone is 10x better than the Moto X Pure, which really surprised me.  Whites are white on the Honor 5X, as compared to yellow on the Moto when compared Side By Side.  Apps load within 1 second of each other as well, and the Moto is suffering from Bluetooth Dropouts after 6.0 update.  So with all that, and this phone being half the price, the choice was easy.

Back to the Honor.  Every review / article I read, seems to be positive other than they all hate the EMUI Android Skin this and other Huawei phones use.  Personally, I like it.  A lot of people love stock android because it's simple.  To me, it's TOO simple...everything is flat, ugly turquoise and you can't do something as simple as display the battery percentage in the status bar, without rooting your phone.

Not here.  The Honor 5x has a TON of useful features and customization options, not to mention the simplest of ones, like being able to re-arrange the soft-keys so the back button is naturally closer, on the right side, to your right thumb, if you're right handed.  Another great feature is double tap to wake the screen, which, for me is VERY useful.  Even with Fingerprint security setup, when the phone is in the car mount, you can still double tap and put in a quick pin, and not have to take it out of the mount and search for the power button.

At first, the fingerprint reader, was not at all a factor, and I thought I wasn't even going to set it up and use it.  Then, I tested it out and really like it now.  The fingerprint control, like swiping down to pull down the notification menu / swiping up to show recent apps and registering a different finger to open a certain app is genius, and already comes natural while using the phone, which means this will be a must on any future phone I may buy.

I've had this phone 3 days and every time I go into settings I find other awesome features.  Just today, under APPS>MORE>CALLS, you can set it to Intensify Vol/Vibrate when phone is in your pocket.  I keep my phone on vibrate in my pocket at work all the time and used to miss text's, e-mails constantly...not anymore.  It's little things like this (there is a TON) make this a worthy replacement and a HUGE upgrade to my aging G2 and for a third of the price.

The only negative I have found so far is in the camera.  Specifically the slow motion video.  When I take a video in slow-mo, the camera app for some reason leaves a couple of seconds at the beginning and end at full speed, making you stretch the bar at each end to make the video 100% slow motion.  Not a big deal at all.  The video itself however is HORRIBLE.  I am either missing a setting or this thing is not recording native 120FPS.  The video comes out grainy and very choppy as if you quick software processed a regular video into slow motion.  Also, if you click the Info button, it shows a resolution of 640x480.  This is a minor negative of course, however 720p 120FPS is clearly advertised as a major feature of this device.  Hopefully a software update fixes this.  The rest of the camera is far better than you'd expect on such a low $$ phone, but obviously nothing spectacular, other than, again tons of little features in the camera settings like:  Capture smiles, object tracking focus, chose what the volume buttons do, the power button does, what holding down the shutter does and, a ton more settings.

Performance wise, this phone is a bit faster, generally speaking than my G2, when loading apps, but ""feels"" 10x faster overall,  because things just flow smoothly.  There is no choppiness while scrolling a simple web page or twitter, and all the animations are smooth and lag free. This would indicate, that since this is a $200 phone using a ""mid range"" processor, Huawei has done a great job optimizing the Software/Hardware to work together flawlessly. I can't wait for android 6.0 EMUI 4.0 which I'm sure will be even snappier and bring on even more features.

Everything you can read about this phone elsewhere is true.
-Solid Feel
-Very Fast, and more importantly, Accurate fingerprint reader.
-Beautiful Screen
-Tons of Features
-Great Battery Life

I am very satisfied with my purchase.  At  $200 you get way more than you should if you compare to other phones.

I would like to see a $100 more premium/flagship version with NFC (for Android Pay)  and Quick Charge, which are probably the only 2 things missing from this phone that a lot of people use, but if you don't need them, this phone is IT!","5.0 out of 5 stars"

This phone definitely fits that to the t. The phone came in a nice looking box. You open the box and find the phone sitting right there. The phone was bigger than I thought it would be but that is a good thing. I have big hands and was expecting for it to be kinda smaller form wise cus like my g3 is. But this phone fits nicely in my hands. The phone has a very high quality feel to it. And is a lot thinner than I was expecting. I know some reviews were saying that they didn't like the ui that Huawei had put on here, but I actually really like this ui. The octacore processor powers through everything I'm doing with ease, I use my phone for everything and it keeps right up with me. Some people's reviews were saying that the sound quality and speakers weren't very good. But mine are very loud and great sound, not the best I've heard but nowhere near the worst. The battery life is absolutely amazing, when I got my phone itnwas on 57% out of the box. I downloaded all my apps, was downloading stuff from the internet and playing games for hours and by about 1:30am I was on 30%, so the battery life is awesome. I wish the internal storage would have been 32gb like my g3 but I can always buy a microsd card. I'm currently using mine on metropcs and it works great, although it wouldn't register on the network without me calling metropcs and giving them the imei number so they could put it on my account. But once I did that it registered before i even got off the phone. The screen is really nice, haven't noticed any washout in colors and 1080p videos and games look great. It charges alil slower than Im use to but its not that big of deal. When I first started checking this phone out I liked that it had a fingerprint scanner but I didn't know how much I would actually use it, but now that I got the phone I don't know how I used a phone without one. The fingerprint scanner is so fast, and once you turn on the gestures under fingerprint settings it easily makes the fingerprint scanner usefull for everything. It unlocks the phone in less than a second its really fast. The camera performs and looks so so much better than I thought as well. Usually with the cheaper phones the camera is a major corner where they cut, but not Huawei they have put an awesome camera in here. It's on par if not better than my lg g3, the front facing camera is very good as well. I haven't really messed with the beauty feature of the front facing camera yet. I have included some pics I had shot using the back camera and the front facing camera. Overall this phone is the best phone for the $200 range hands down. I recommend getting the tempered glass screen protector as well to protect the screen, which is what I have done. You will not be disappointed by this phone. Huawei you have done an amazing job with the Honor 5x, this phone has made me a Huawei fan. All my next phones are gonna be Huawei phones now!","5.0 out of 5 stars"

"","","I just got this and I already love it, might be too early to say that but this phone is awesome. Great design, looks and feels expensive, everyone says it does. I don't use phones much, this is my first phone in 3 years, better than the one I had that was slowing down, which was a 4 year old model samsung Galaxy. For a mid-range smartphone it's pretty high end in quality for me. Runs everything smoothly, games, apps, etc exactly the way I want it to. I don't do anything too drastic on it because I have a laptop for the heavier lighting. This phone makes me want to use it everyday, I love the sleek looking UI, very refreshing from the traditional android look. I can't keep my hands off of it. Haha. If this continues to impress me, I will surely be purchasing other Huawei phones in the future!!","5.0 out of 5 stars"

The phone as a whole feels great! The fingerprint scanner is wonderful and very accurate, the screen is large and vibrant, but overall the software that comes with the phone (EMUI 3.1) is terrible. The Snapdragon 615 processor that comes with the phone is powerful, but hampered greatly by EMUI. I tried to use it for about two months, but it became unbearably slow, with frequent framerate drops, reboots, and poor app performance.

The good news is, Huawei makes rooting the device relatively easy. All you have to do is make an account on their website, request an unlock code for your phone, and you're good to go. Having done that, and installed a custom ROM, this phone became less of a brick and more of a wonderful powerhouse. I'm currently running it with a custom Android Marshmallow 6.1 with an unofficial CyanogenMod 13 Nightly. I couldn't be happier.

There are several things that are great about this phone and some things that are bad about it

The Good:
Battery Life: Best battery life I've ever had in a phone. A full charge lasts me through the day without a problem and I am a pretty heavy phone user so a huge thumbs up on the battery.

Fingerprint Sensor: The fingerprint sensor is the highlight of this phone considering its price. It reacts super fast and I haven't had any problems with it recognizing my finger. Not only does it unlock your phone you can set it up to open apps with certain fingers and can even be used to do tasks while the phone is unlocked.

Screen: It might not be the best looking 1080p panel out there but it looks great. It gets bright enough to see in the daylight and dark enough to not hurt your eyes if you wake up in the middle of the night to check your phone

Versatility: What I mean by this is that since the phone is unlocked you can use it with any GSM phone company that use the bands that this phone support. I am currently on Straight Talk and it works flawlessly. It has dual sims so you can use it with a company number as well as a personal number on the same phone.

Design: Beautiful. That's the one word that I would use to describe it. The brushed metal finish feels premium and looks premium in your hands.

The Bad:
Speaker: I'm glad that I have a wireless speaker I can connect this to. Music sounds awful coming through the speaker and I don't think any equalizer apps will fix this. But on the plus side it gets loud enough to wake the dead with an alarm.

Cameras: Megapixels don't mean a thing when the pixels don't look good. The camera constantly over or under exposes photos and they just don't look very good. But what should you expect from a $200 phone with all of the amazing features already?

That's the end of my review. I hope that this review helps with your impulse buying habits and you make the right choice for what you need.","5.0 out of 5 stars"

Other than that, this phone really should be worth twice as much as it is priced. 1080p display, microsd card (on top of a not-some-puny 8gb internal storage), 120 fps camera, fingerprint sensor, dual sim, LTE, etc. For $199, I can definitely overlook the lack of gyroscope and stock android.

The EMUI skin also surprised me. I am absolutely disgusted with that iOS look, however, the skinning didn't bog down the OS like I would expect as TouchWiz and some other skinned OS have shown. Still, the iOS look is ugly. But again, for $199, that can be overlooked. Also, with EMUI, there is no shortcut to battery screen from the pulldown notifications. That is rather annoying. You can long tap the ultra battery shortcut but that will give you only battery saving options. I want to be able to diagnose screen on time and battery consumption from the shortcut without going through system settings.The lockscreens are also horrible. Then again, this phone is $199.

This ia a prime example of ""today's cheap phone is last year's expensive phone."" Lately a bunch of budget phones have been out but they're still just as terrible as phones from two years ago. Technology is supposed to get cheaper for the same piece of technology but we haven't been observing that with a bunch of other ""budget options"" (Cough cough Moto G). This H5X begs to differ and proves that for $199, you can get last year's near premium phone for a budget price.","5.0 out of 5 stars"

Love the fingerprint security (had to program it for use through my thicker case)  I went from a Samsung Galaxy to the Huawai and love it just as much.

Good battery life.  I found them pretty easy to get used to after the Samsung.  I like the dual memory cards if I want to expand.  My photos are crisp and clear and even my selfies are not too bad. Camera has a food level, beauty level, time lapse photography in addition to regular photos and videos plus pretty decent editor.  The sound quality is decent.

This is my first experience with an unlocked phone.  It has been a 10 star experience.  Switching this phone to my existing Straight Talk account was a mere 30 minutes of swap over time plus one 'restart.'  The speed leaves my Samsung in the dust.  I am slightly thankful my Samsung took an accidental spin in the washing machine ~

I have no cable, no internet or Wi-Fi, and no landline in my home.  My cell phone is my ONLY connection to the outside world. So, leaving the security of my Samsung Galaxy device was a major panic attack .. But clearly a needless fear.  I put a tempered glass screen protector on the Honor and it in no way affects the speed of navigating the phone.  For an android the navigation is a bit different, but I had no problem finding my way around the phone and getting everything set-up.  I already have one co-worker wanting to ""UPGRADE"" from their overpriced flagship device.

The Honor 5X provides incredible mobile data speed and interaction with the outside world from my 'unwired home' is fantastic with this device.  Some reviews left me questioning my choice as I hit the ""Place Order"" button ... but it does not disappoint.  CNET and PC Magazine were not overly generous with their reviews, but my initial reaction is to disagree.  If I have any issues, I will be back to update.

But for now the Honor 5X is too good to be true for the price.","5.0 out of 5 stars"

My review will concentrate on my personal experience with this phone.

There is a lot of technical info on the Honor site as well as good information in the Q & A under other reviewers' comments. So please refer to those sections to get technical aspects on this device.

This phone came unlocked, so I ordered an H20 sim card from Amazon (only $.01!), installed it, ported my number, and activated my new service. I had to configure with the help of customer service, but that went fairly smoothly.

Please note: The battery is permanent, and the phone does not open up. The sim and micro SD slots are accessible from the side, using the pin tool provided--Do not lose it!

I YouTubed a video to install my cards properly. It was easy to do.

Let me start off by saying this is a beautiful phone!! The aluminum case gives the phone a high-end feel and a look of quality construction. It is thin, sleek, but substantial in your hand. It's kind of large, but that makes it better for viewing, especially if your eyesight is not perfect. We also have a Samsung S5 in the house, and this one compares well to it, especially in terms of its construction.

The large screen is beautiful to look at. Netflix looks amazing on this phone. This phone is marketed to people born in the computer age. No manual needed--just intuitive exploration. Even though I haven't had a smart phone before, most everything I want to do is apparent. Apps load quickly, and the touch screen is responsive.

The fingerprint ID function on this phone is a great feature. It quickly unlocks the phone, answers a call, or can take a photo. It was easy for me to set up and feels futuristic.

The camera is 13 megapixels and takes a gorgeous shot. (Please refer to photo.) You can adjust a few things, but not so many that it's intimidating to use.

I've loaded Amazon Prime Music on here (easily and quickly) and have had no problems. I Bluetoothed it to my headphones, and it sounds great.

I'm paranoid, so I did put a screen protector on it, but this may be overkill on a screen that already has a special coating on it. I've also ordered a protective case (sad that it will cover the beautiful aluminum, but I want to protect it from drops). There are not many styles available yet because this phone is so new. A clear case would be much prettier.

All in all, can't see why you'd spend $500+ when you can get this really beautiful and nicely made phone with all the functions for less than half that price.

I really believe this is a nice mid-priced smartphone. This may be a game changer for Huawei.","5.0 out of 5 stars"

I had an iPhone before someone stole it and thought I wouldn't find a nice cheap phone to replace it in the mean time.
I found there was an offer, and just clicked on Buy, and by the time it was on my hands I just hoped for the best.
At first I thought 'Wow, this is really big phone', but once I got used to it, I really liked it. It has a nice alumium finish on the back that makes it look elegant.
The fingerprint sensor works perfectly, and has other functionalities than just unlock the phone, I can control the camera, the notification panel, etc...
I though,'well, it's brand new now, maybe when I download some apps and stuff It starts lagging or having problems', but not at all, I have it now for like 2 month with all the apps I need, and no problems at all, it works really fast.
Other cool spec is the 2 sim Cards slots and the sd slot... I really missed having the freedom to expand the memory when I want, without having to buy a new phone.
Battery is never ending, I'm not actually someone who uses the phone 24 hours intensively, like for games or that kind of things. Just regular use, calls, messaging, Social networks, News, Music, Word,Excel,Mail, Browsers, etc. with 4G always on, or Wi-Fi. For a regular day, by the time I arrive home I still have 70% of the battery, after like 10 hours away.(Obviously it depends on what I do that day) ...
The only thing I'm not really happy about, is the camera, it doesn't have the best quality, sometimes photos are moved, or not focused. If you take your time, you'll have a nice photo, but if you want to take a quick photo, it's not that good. Usually photos taken by this phone have some noise... If you expect the iPhone camera on this device, it's not for you... But don't forget it's a 200 usd phone, photos are not terrible, just regular, let's say it's not it's best specification.
I've noticed some people compaint about the EMUI software, I don't think it's terrible, or perfect, it just there, neutral. If you don't like it you can always download another launcher, but I had no problems with it yet.
So, there are some of my thoughts... I really like this phone, and I really like the price of course, you can have everything you need for a good price, nothing to envy to other more expensive phones. I'm really happy with it, and I'm staying with it because it works great, and I really like it, it doesn't make me miss my iPhone that much.
I even bought my mom one of this phones and she likes it too.","5.0 out of 5 stars"

I have had just about every high end smart phone from LG, HTC and Samsung and I can honestly say, the Honor 5x is not far off.  People can argue the other flagship phones have better camera's, processor, display, etc but the Honor 5x is no slouch.

Personally, I can't tell much of a performance difference and perhaps the camera isn't as good (but 13MP is perfectly fine for me).  I use mine with T-Mobile and it's worked flawlessly.

Why pay triple or even quadruple for other flagship phones when you can have this for $200??","5.0 out of 5 stars"

Just like with anything else, how much you love or hate this phone says almost as much about you and your needs in a phone as it says about the phone itself.  I generally don't have my phone constantly at my finger tips but I have had it there much more often since getting this phone.  I don't spent a ton of time talking or texting and I don't frequently stream videos or play many games on my phone and I still prefer to use a camera to take photos. The apps I use are primarily tied to reading books and listening to audiobooks, I've got Audible, Kindle, Overdrive Media Console, Goodreads, wordweb, wordbrain, NOAA weather, Netflix and Pandora that I downloaded and use on a regular basis.

My first impression of this phone wasn't a good one, when I opened the box it was already on. I think the power button must have gotten pushed somehow when I was taking it out of the bubble wrap mailer. The phone gave me a message; software is installing with 0% installed displayed on the screen.  This message displayed on the screen for over an hour with no change in the % installed.  There are no directions in the box and a sticker on the back that says only an authorized dealer should removed the battery. I was worried I had gotten a dud. Holding the power button down to restart the phone would pop up a message saying restarting the phone could cause damage.  The whole thing was weird. My ten year old thought he'd be helpful and (without my knowing) held the power button down despite the phone giving a very clear message stating you shouldn't.  Thankfully it solved the problem and the phone started right up as if there had never been a problem and its been fine ever since.

Second impressions were better, the phone is quick. It starts up quickly, loads quickly, connects to wifi quickly, it's just quick, I touch the screen and the phone's response is super quick. The phone is a nice weight, it's not too heavy, it's a comfortable size in my hand and it feels good to hold.  I like that it has a gloves mode for the touch screen, perfect for those of us who live where winter often lasts five months. The gloves mode can be found in settings/smart assistance/more.

I like
the look and feel of the phone.
that the resolution and picture quality are good.
that it has good battery life.
the separate volume settings for ringtone, media, alarm, call.
that it comes with a screen protector already on the phone.
that swipe is already loaded into the keyboard so you don't have to download the app the swipe feature makes typing really quick
that it gives me consumption reminders that I have apps running that are draining my battery
that it was really easy to walk into the at&t store and set up the phone service

I was a little less impressed with
the sound quality of the phone, I expected it to be better than it is.
its fussiness connecting to my Bluetooth devices (only sometimes, not always).
the quick dial feature that doesn't show me who I have programed into my quick dial numbers on the phone screen.
the fact that my text log doesn't show a photo of my contacts next to their texts.
the fact that there's no quick dial buttons at the top of my contacts list.
the camera, despite it's big megapixel number it's really not great for shooting pictures of anything that's moving or very far away. There are really cool editing features and filters on the camera and a panoramic feature as well but the lag time from pressing the shutter button to when the camera takes the photo is significant. If you are shooting pictures of bunnies while they are sitting still you'll be fine but shooting moving people that are any distance away is going to be frustrating and disappointing.

Over all I do like this phone but I wish the camera and sound quality were better. I think people who have smartphones with good cameras are going to be disappointed by the photos this camera takes.  For people who are just now upgrading to a smart phone or are looking for something for their children I think this will be a good fit for them. I find myself using this like a little tablet and it works very nicely for me in that way.","4.0 out of 5 stars"

Second Week and so many thing don't work right as you will read below.
In the Fingerprint Management opens then closes instantly. I finally had to turn off my protection to open or start the phone because 'fingerprint does not match'. I know after 3 fingerprint denials it opens the number screen pad and you enter your password. that's a lot of work to be able to use your phone every time the phone keeps Shutting Itself Off! and I cannot fix my fingerprint because the Fingerprint Management Screen won't stay open... as I type this review I tried to get in again: deleted my two registered prints that are never recognized  tried to add a new one, 3/4 of it was done when the page closed and sent me to the Home screen.

on a call sounds from the other end are all distorted/ and garbled. I don't know if it's the whole phone problem or a perhaps just a speaker issue. I can't understand the IVR telling me what to do.
Any Hold Music is way off and Most Important I have to keep asking for repeats from the person i am trying to talking to.
you cannot use the phone's Help Screen to email Huawei because the country has to be picked from the dropdown or the email cannot even be started without a country selected. The United States is not on the list. neither are Canada and England. I am in Massachusetts speaking English

TWO STARS, really should be 1.  ***This ""Unlocked Huawei Honor 5X"" phone was fantastic for a week.*** Just One Week then all the above started.

I will be phoneless until I can buy an unlocked GSM phone. I bought a Tracfone SIM and 60 minutes of talk/text/web. A Gorilla Glass screen protector, two really pretty covers and a pop-on jelly protector for the back of the phone.  I WILL attempt a Factory Data Reset and start all over fresh with it first. Pray for me Amazon accepts The RETURN of the phone and covers. This is all a lot of money. I don't want to be told to send it back to China for repairs.

Updating my review to give credit to Amazon Customer Service for once again exceeding expections. One call to them and they sent a replacement for the first phone. This is my 2nd day with #2, voices are clearer and it hasn't shut itself off once. Now I can enjoy my NEW Huawei Honor 5x. If it continues to behave well I will return here with the 5th star.
Thank you Wuawei for mark ng an affordable 5"" screen available in the USA!","4.0 out of 5 stars"

It is perhaps the best that I have owned so far.  I have used Blackberry phones, the iPhone, Nexus 4, Zenfone 2 among others. I must add that I have only had it for over a week.  However, this Honor 5X stands out in most of the categories as follows:

Pros:
1. Price- This Honor 5X takes the top spot in this category- mid-range smartphones. It is the best phone in its price range ($200) for 2016 so far.
2. Hardware- It has a full metal casing that makes it look very gorgeous. It also feels very sturdy and not too heavy.
3. Software- It has Huawei's EMUI, which is not that bad at all. There is no app drawer, which makes it resemble an iPhone, but that is not a deal breaker for me. In fact, I like it that way. The apps appear quite nice on the screen.
4. Fingerprint scanner- This is what makes this phone a steal for its price.  The fingerprint scanner is relatively quick and makes using this phone a joy.
5. Battery life- I was pleasantly surprised by the longevity of this phone's battery. I use the phone heavily daily, but at mid-night I still have about 40% of battery life left. This is amazing.

Cons
1. The camera- It is nothing great to write home about.  It takes OK pics, but it could have been better.
2. The speaker- It is not a top-quality speaker by any stretch of the imagination. In fact it sounds tinny at times.  Beyond this is my major gripe with this speaker- its location on the phone at the bottom near the charging port. I find myself covering it up when I am typing and doing other things. They should have placed it on the front of the phone and made it a stereo speaker.  However, it does ring extremely loud and I hear people clearly.

Despite the few cons, the Huawei Honor 5X is an amazing phone. I can't even put it down somewhere for a moment. I always want to hold it and do something on it. It feels great in my hand and the screen is bright and clear. The price is right and the experience is topnotch. This phone has exceeded my expectations. I recommend this phone to anyone who would like a very good smartphone at a very reasonable price.","5.0 out of 5 stars"

Apparently a postal employee needed a new phone and choose my order. No worries Amazon quickly refunded my money. All is good.

Update: March 22, 2016.....Finally received Phone, Typical Chinese Phone with awkward skin over Android 5.1, no big deal though. As a person who lives in S.E. Asia most of the year......I see these phones everyday.

I've already :
1. Unlocked the bootloader..............(See XDA for instructions)
2. Rooted the Phone
3. Installed a custom recovery.....twrp
4. Installed Titanium Backup with root privileges
5. Removed bloatware using TB
6. Installed Nova launcher.....(Google launcher is also available)
7. Adjusted power saving features in settings

By doing these steps you will .......
1. Speed up the phone
2. Have a much more familiar interface for USA / Western  users
3. Ability to remove Huawei bloatware..........When Chinese manufacturers install ""Updates"" They frequently package advertising apps as an update.

For USA buyers this is about the best deal available currently in 200 dollar range","4.0 out of 5 stars"

Hopefully you have unlimited data, or else. This phone is not rooted and doesn't currently work with usb otg cables and devices. Wifi Direct works for transferring items.

I thought I had big hands, but this phone is ridiculously large. It has features to make it easier to use, but it is big and heavy. It would be the perfect phone if it were an inch smaller. I will probably have to return it. These phablets  are going to look dumb in a few years when phone companies finally start making smaller phones again.

Requires a little tool to access the SD card slot, and the nano Sim card is on the same tray. Not convenient for swapping out the SD cards. I got a sim adapter, so I could use my nano sim in the other tray.

Tethering/Hotspot  no longer works with straight talk wireless, but that might just be an android 5.1 issue.

Fingerprint sensor is amazing. Similar specs as the iPhone 6plus. Download Apex launcher and that will make the phone better. The gravity app also adds the missing active display elements that make life easier.","3.0 out of 5 stars"

I use my phone for calls, texts, browsing, YouTube, Multiple email accounts and calendars, photos, videos, you get it.

Maybe if you are a gamer, or someone who is really into phones and technology...maybe? This phone was easy to get online with Straight Talk, add more memory with a SD card and start using it.  Whatever nuances mentioned in other reviews are just that to me, nuances. Very happy with this purchase, especially for $200.

Afterword it would try repeatedly to boot on and off. It never fully reboot completely on again.  I had to let the battery die down.  I then waited several days then tried to change it enough to see if it would corrected itself but it is still booting on and off.  Considering what I paid for this; it is not made sturdy at all.  The covers that is advertised as metal is more accurately only a metal outer ring with a painted plastic back insert.
If this phone was sturdy I would have loved it because it has a lot of memory. Also will accommodate A SD card on top of the avalible memory.  I love the ideal of having a lot of memory for a lot of apps.  I would have like the size because it is not too big or too small.  It is  around 6 inches long by 3 inches wide.  But the phone is not made for regular use it falls apart as easy as a cheap toy. Also, the otter case is no support at all because its only a metal outer ring with plastic covering the other parts.  By the way the phone advertise that it has a metal backing. I doubt tgat that is true.  The return policy only allows only 30 days.  I tried to call the honor customer service.  They said that because it fell out of my pocket the warranty was voided. So I took a very large hit with this phone.  I have had cheaper phone do better than this.","1.0 out of 5 stars"

It's fast, easy to use, screen resolution is great. The phone is exactly as described.

I don't like the size of the phone, I prefer them to be smaller, and I'm not a huge fan of needing a tool to access the SD card. But, for the price, there's more important things you could complain about.

Audio quality on videos recorded- this was a big disappointment for me because I go to a lot of concerts and like to take videos, but listening to them the next day they're awful - can't even tell what song I was recording
Is a big slow/laggy even after changing the battery saving to Normal. Noticeably slower than iPhone.","3.0 out of 5 stars"

I am not one of those people who usually care about a lot of phone features as I basically use it for occasional calls and to listen to music while at work. My last phone was a Blu Dash 5.0 and I was happy with that but I did not like that it would not allow me to download a lot of apps or move them to my SD card and then I dropped it; cracking the screen. So after another year, I went phone shopping and I wanted twice the space and a longer battery. I got that with this phone along with a finger print ID, gesture control, super fast processor and a great looking piece! I am so happy with this phone that I probably will never go back to Blu and they were my phone company of choice for quite some time.","5.0 out of 5 stars"

But before I did that, I went to do some research and see if there's alternative. I really didn't want to pay $25 a month for 24 months.

Then I came across this phone the Honor 5X. Looked at the specs, and felt this should be more than enough for my son. Luckily for me I was able to preoder the device.

Phone came in a couple days later. Opened the box and am very pleased with the look and feel of the phone. The phone comes with a screen protector. I personally love that there's no branding on the front of the phone. Which is why I usually love iPhone and Nexus phones.

Now the OS is running Android 5.1.1 with Huawei's skin EMUI 3.1.

The OS feels very IOS like. There's no built in app drawer. Of course you could just download a home launcher. I really like how the notification looks. I like the animations on this phone.

I did come across a few problems when trying to run games. Some games won't even run at all. Which could be a huge problem for some mobile gamers out there.

Other than that, I think this is a solid phone. Especially for this price. If you compare spec by spec with other t-mobile phones for $200. You'll only be able to buy low end phones such as the Galaxy Avant which is a horrible android experience.","4.0 out of 5 stars"

I have always used top end devices from samsung and apple this gets really close to them, well excluding the picture quality.

My usage is everything but gaming and this phone runs a solid day and half, the battery life is  awesome. Multi tasking is really fast, definitely better if not same then highest end phones.

The skin is mix of iphone and Android, unique. I prefer it over any other launchers.

Call quality over speaker phone had echo for some reason . Nfc would have been nice.

Blu threw a curve ball when they released the vivo xl for $99 bucks. I opted to buy the vivo xl. After having the vivo xl for a week I could not live with out a fingerprint scanner. I bought the honor 5x on eBay today and I am blown away but at the same time disappointed by the UI performance. Compared to the vivo xl, navigating around the UI, the honor 5x is very laggy. Both are heavily skinned, and both are running lollipop. I do enjoy emui better than the vivo xl skin. I also enjoy having soft keys on my phone capacitive buttons. The vivo xl also does not have backlights on their buttons which annoyed me a ton, also the arrangements of the buttons. Do not know why blu decided to change the order of the OEM Android buttons. The fingerprint scanner on the honor 5x is very quick. Faster than the Samsung s6 and iPhone 6s plus scanner. I do not mind emui, looks very nice(rip off of ios). I do like the button shapes and icons. I usually download Google's messaging app but the honor 5x default app is very nice and I like how the sms threads are designed. You can scroll between dialer, contacts, and messages all in one app. The screen is nice and sharp but not as vibrant as the vivo xl. The vivo xl uses an amoled display but only at 720p. The build quality if the honor 5x is at another level compared to the vivo xl. The vivo xl is cheap plastic on the back and a metal body. The honor 5x is a combination of metal and plastic(minimal). Many reviewers are complaining about the screen being a fingerprint magnet but buying a screen protector will help a ton. Overall I must admit both phones are great but for the extra $80 bucks I got a 1080p display, metal body phone, and a finger print scanner. I do not care that it does not have nfc. Have not used Android pay or apple pay once. USB c doesn't affect me....I have a ton of micro USB cables laying around. I am pleased with my purchase so far. I'm pretty sure honor is going to provide better support for updates versus blu. We shall see!","5.0 out of 5 stars"

I don't think I made any real sacrifices in terms of hardware design or software. I am overall very excited to continue to learn about this device, and extend my knowledge to Huawei and Honor, as well as what the budget market looks like and turns into.

So far after 5 days of use, I have had no hiccups. I am able to use my 5X the same way I used my Moto X, but with this new phone I get better battery life and a larger screen that's just as beautiful as my Moto X was(I had that custom made and engraved, so much fun). I have noticed that a lot of internet resources have said the EMUI is hit or miss for them but I really enjoy the different approach Honor has taken with it, and it really helps me save battery, so I'm happy. If you like Android, don't shy away because of the UI, you can get around a lot of it and if you give it a fair shot, it might surprise you too.

For $200, you get more than your money's worth with this device. It's solid, built to withstand the use it can be put through, and it is as attractive to look at on the outside as what's on the inside to power you through your days. It's a powerhouse next to other ""Budget"" phones, but no slouch when put up against the heavyweights.

My pros: The fingerprint scanner works like a champion, always. The bonus use from it is very clever and really intuitive. The screen is amazingly vibrant and there are no defects or backlight issues to speak of. The body is wondrous. I can't believe I got all of this device and it's internals for just under $200. I am impressed beyond my expectations, and glad that I returned three other phones to get this one.

My cons: I have to wait for another Honor device when the time comes to move beyond this device and further expand my knowledge and satisfaction. :-D

NO NONSENSE. Honor isn't playing around, and you should be as brave as they are being. You want this device, it will satisfy your needs and you can feel good about what you spent your money on.","5.0 out of 5 stars"

It was super easy to set up and this is coming from someone who hasn't had a new phone in 5 years. The first thing I did was insert my SIM card (T-Mobile) and a new 32GB SDHC card. This was accomplished by using the included tool to open the slots. Then I charged the phone completely. When I turned the phone on, it booted up fast. I was worried it would be a big hassle to replace all my apps but it went pretty well. I like the ability to customize this phone to my liking. It's easy to use and I was up and running right away. The sound quality is good and I like the auto-bright screen feature.

I had no trouble going from my old phone (Samsung S2) to the Honor 5X and that was my biggest concern.

The finger print scanner works seamlessly into the design and functionality, It took me a day to remember to set my finger on the back and it takes .0000005 seconds to read the print to unlock the phone. The screen is super bright and crisp, the only downside is the black border around the display, but its hardly noticeable. The Honor 5X is hands down the best budget phone on the market, it hasn't lagged out on me once and i haven't had an app crash yet. Metal body is smooth and could pass for a HTC A9, I still don't know how this phone is only $199.00, Usually big companies cut corners on budget smart phones as i have found out first hand. the Moto G looks like your playing minecraft with the screen resolution, the nexus 5 was all plastic, every BLU phone has a crappy screen, software, oh and the most important thing, BLU phones come with Sh*t hardware.

I wanted them to have updated phones with decent specs and im glad I made this move.

PROS: Price - $200
Screen - 1080P LCD Goodness that is very vibrant and bright.

Materials - A nice metal build that looks premium and feels good in the hand, not as good as HTC?

Camera - very good performer for $200 , perfect for social media.

Speaker - pretty loud for ringtones and mediocre for listening to music.

Battery - 3000 mAh , enough for a day of normal use!

Finger print scanner works very fluid

Cons - The phones would lag if I started to do heavy multitasking which included the opening of more than 4+ apps , and trying to move through the phone really fast.  This is quite normal since we are dealing with a mid range CPU and 2GB ram.

Overall the speed is quite sufficient if you aren't speeding through the phone.

- Easy to set up and use with my SIM chip from AT&T
- LED light on the front to detect messages or emails
- Useful extra features like screen shrink to more easily access the icons and keyboard on the large screen

Cons:
- Huawei Emotion OS is crap...it basically turns your Android phone into an iPhone with no app tray!  This is easily fixed however by downloading the Google Now Launcher from the Play Store
- There is no NFC chip so you can't use Android Pay for anything

The first thing I noticed when I turned it on was that the processor was significantly slower than the iPhone. It took me a bit of getting use to, to find the app store and get a re-feel of how things worked. The App Store has added a bunch more apps since the last time I was there (like Instagram, yay) but it was also missing a few key apps I use on a daily basis as well. This isn't a huge deal breaker since my daily apps as a blogger are not the same as someone else's but in my experience, I was pretty bummed out about this. The camera in general is a little confusing to understand. But it's equipped with a 13MP camera which is pretty good. The camera also includes a number of interesting features to play around with.

The phone is nicely weighted and it's pretty well made. I do like how you can easily upgrade the storage by using a micro SD card (iPhone get on it!), that makes the storage possibilities with this phone unlimited! The front screen is a really nice size as it takes up the majority of the face. The fingerprint feature on the back is also a nice touch and it's out of the way and doesn't take up space on the front face.

Overall for the price you're getting a pretty legit phone. The price point isn't so bad either for a phone that runs like this. If you're looking for a well made functioning phone without having to pay those annoying monthly fees with carriers I would suggest picking this one up!","4.0 out of 5 stars"

NO WIFI Calling.. This is a big deal breaker. I am so disappointed.
Alcatel 3 years old phone has wifi calling and most of the new generation phones have Wifi calling.. Audio - less than moderate. Camera good for selfie's and close up shorts that is it. Little movement makes turns into blur.(Good for Statues).
If people do not mind the above, It is okay phone with metal body, fingerprint etc., You can use other apps to make calls. But cannot save your monthly minutes period. This is not an advanced phone for all the noise they made for all the launch in asian other middle east countries for opening. I would not personally recommend this phone","2.0 out of 5 stars"

I'm not going to tell you too much about the sophisticated build quality because enough has been posted on Amazon and YouTube. Feel free to read and watch. This review is my 1st day personal user experience. I also have to mention that this phone is unique in the sense that it is ONLY $200 and i'll be mentioning the price point frequently in my review.

T-Mobile SIM card and 64 gig Micro SD card went in without any trouble. 4G/LTE on T-Mobile is flawless. And Yes confirmed, NO BAND 12.
Phone powered and booted without any problems, Setup was a breeze. Screen quality is excellent, colors, brightness and viewing angles satisfactory considering the price point. Absolutely NO bloatware (Excellent Job Honor).Uninstalled two apps Facebook and Shazam without any trouble.

The device lagged a few places initially when I was uninstalling apps I don't use and installing apps that I do.  Lag is minimum and non-significant. You might experience some lag when you reboot the device and as you continue to use apps and network, lagging gets better. Not any different than my nexus 6 or my wife's iPhone 6+.The phone is very snappy and screen is very responsive. Changed the power setting to normal and added some more protected apps to run when the sreen is off as suggested by reviewers. Sound is above average and satisfactory considering the price point. Video quality is excellent. Finger print sensor is the winner and setting up finger print was easy and quick.

Finally EMUI. The answer is ""it is different"". It is not bad, Just different. I actually like the different look and feel of the EMUI. It takes a little getting used to but nothing that you can't adjust to in a matter of a few hours. No fast charging but I used a different charger and was able to charge it completely in 1.5 hours. I think the original charger is slow. No NFC, but oh well. You still Can't Go Wrong With It considering the price.

Lets be honest. For $200 bucks this device is a steal and can easily be used as your daily driver. Unlocked without any contract and no monthly payments makes you a winner in every way. Pick it up and you wont regret.

It's really a nice looking phone, I highly recommend the sunset gold color. I am a casual phone user so this phone works very well with my usual needs, internet,EMAIL, camera,etc.

The only issue I have is that I usually use 4 keyboards on my iphone 5, English,Chinese pinyin,Chinese handwriting,and emoji. But with honor 5X, it seems that I can only have english and Chinese Pinyin using either Google Keyboard or Huawei Keyboard.

It's okay. The group messaging works like a charm as opposed to the Mate 7; the screen is a tab bit smaller, but I can live with that as well considering all of the pros. The batter lasts at least a day before a charge even with power intensive apps running in the background. It's fairly fast and I have Lite with Cricket services. The fingerprint sensor works amazingly well and it is very accurate as opposed to the Mate 2. It comes with a pre-installed screen protector which was nice. It has a nice amount of storage as well with the amount of apps that I use, but I also have a 32gig SD card in it from the previous phone, but I noticed that when I download something, it doesn't give me the option to put it on the SD card. It also has a radio app that can be used when you plug in your headphones. Last but not least, WIFI works like a charm; no disconnections what so ever.","4.0 out of 5 stars"

In my first thought, I really liked the phone. It was certainly a well built phone all around. The Fingerprint sensor did not disappoint me at all. Screen, UI, and overall navigation was great in first few hours of use. Thought this is replacement I've been looking for. Spent almost all day downloading needed apps, arranged all the apps and screen based on my need, copied some music on the MicroSD card, setup all my email accounts, restored all my messages, calendar from a file and got the phone ready.

After all of this, I turned the phone off to insert the microSD card and microSIM card into the phone, just when I turned the phone on, the whole thing just went down the drain. MY APPS ARRANGEMENT JUST WENT DEFAULT TO ALPHABETICAL. LOST ALL OF MY SETTINGS. Even restoring the phone from the backup did not return the phone to its original state when it was back up.. (Oh yeah, forgot to mention, just incase anything goes wrong I used Huawei's backup app which came pre-installed.... Clearly it didn't do sh*%t)

I've had much pricier phones that don't perform as well or feel as good in my hand as this one does. It has all the features I would ever want or need in a phone & is pretty easy to use, despite not coming with any instructions (except what is on the sticker affixed to the back of the phone). I love the camera on this phone-it seems to take much clearer pictures without the annoying delay that is on my Samsung. The slightly bigger screen is a plus too, since I use my camera quite frequently. I have many apps on the phone & have not had any issues with locking up or lagging, My only negative with this phone is the battery is not removable, so unlike other phones that can be 'rebooted' by removing the battery & putting it back in if necessary-that is not possible with the Honor 5X.

Sold, sold an iPhone 6s Plus, paid off the Apple loan, and began a hunt for a new phone. Did a JUMP on demand with T-Mobile for the LG G4. Nice phone, great camera. For $399 it's a great deal. Have four days to take back so wanted to look for possible unlocked alternatives. Was not ready to pull the trigger on a Nexus 6P just yet. Looked at a Nexus 6 too even though it's over 15 months old now - but for $399, it's a great phone too. Then, I saw this 5X being reviewed all over the place, with reviewers going nuts over the $199 price. So, luckily, went straight to Amazon and bought it on release day, January 31st. Was expecting this to be a ""holdover"" phone while I searched for a permanent higher-end Android. It arrived today.

After installing all my apps and knowing that this pretty much resembles - software designn-wise - iOS - I have to say this is a very pleasant surprise. May keep this handset a while. I'm kind of amazed this level of tech can be had for $199. The fingerprint unlock works awesome, the fingerprint gestures are quite innovative, and I'm actually quite a fan of Huawei's software design choices. While they echo iOS quite a bit, the EMUI feels quite elegant and works rather well. We will see how a few days goes and if things get weird with the 5X, but for now, my opinion is that this is an incredible bargain for $199. Yes, I only have 1GB of storage left after all the app installs (would have paid $30 more for 32GB!), but once Marshmallow comes along and storage can be combined, don't think this will be an issue. I'm not a gamer, so won't need any large games.

If I keep this - which I probably will for a while - will have to get a tempered glass screen protector and a TPU case. Many reviews noted that the glass does not have oleophobic coating, although the preinstalled plastic screen protector will work for now. No NFC - minor worry at this point really. Used it a total of 10 times in a year on the 6 Plus and 6s Plus. Nice, but not required.

Lucky to have this since now shipping times are higher (even with Prime). Way to go, Huawei. Really scored big here. Of, and the underlying Android version is 5.1.1.","5.0 out of 5 stars"

I'm not sure that I have ever owned a phone that was able to pick up signal like this phone (and I've owned nearly every high end phone).  In areas that other phones would struggle to get anything other than 3G signal, I was able to get 2 or 3 bars of LTE signal.  If you live in an area that has less than ideal signal this could be a great option for you.

**Original Review**
Let me start off by saying that it is amazing what $200 or less can get you in terms of smartphones today.  This is a comparison of two of the best phones that fit this category.  I have owned many phones at this price range as well as nearly every high-end phone.

Look and Feel
I own both phones in gold.  Both phones are amazingly thin and lightweight and easy to hold.  The Honor 5X is the biggest surprise here because it is surprisingly lightweight despite having an all metal build.  It terms of looks you have to give the 5X the win here because the phone looks and feels great in the hand.

Software
Both phones are running Android Lollipop (5.1 for the Vivo XL, and 5.1.1 for the 5X), and both phones have pretty heavy skins over Lollipop.  The 5X probably has the heavier skin here, which I consider a negative, and honestly it feels like they tried to turn an Android phone into an Iphone.  Ultimately I ran Nova Launcher on both phones to give them a more stock Android experience.

Processing Power
I would argue that this is the biggest difference between the two phones.  The 5X uses the Snapdragon 616 processor, while the Vivo XL uses an “off brand” Mediatek processor.  Without a doubt I give the win to the Mediatek processor in the Vivo XL.  The Snapdragon 616 is by no means a horrible processor, but you will undoubtedly experience lag from time to time.  The Mediatek processor isn’t going to blow you away with its speed, but you also won’t get frustrated waiting for it either.

Camera
Both phones take good, not great pictures in well lit conditions.  In low-lighting conditions neither phone takes great pictures.  The camera is not a huge selling point for either phone, but they do a pretty darn good job for the price you are paying.

Antennas and Network Compatibility
I use Cricket Wireless (which uses AT&T towers), and each phone basically has the same antennas.  Both phones are unlocked for all GSM carriers, but the win here has to go to the Honor 5X because I consistently have better signal in the same locations when using the 5X.

Screen Quality
The 5X has a 1080P LCD screen while the Vivo XL has a 720P Super AMOLED screen.  The 5X has more detail and gets brighter, but the colors of the Vivo XL have more “pop” to them.

Battery Life
The Honor 5X has decent battery life with its 3000 mAh battery.  I generally get around 4 hours of screen on time with the 5X.  The Vivo XL has excellent battery life with its 3150 mAh battery that is removable and swappable.  I generally could get 5-6 hours of screen on time with the Vivo XL.  The Vivo XL also has fast charging, whereas the Honor 5X charges significantly slower.  In the battery category the Vivo XL is the clear winner.

Why you should buy the Honor 5X:
1) Better build 2) fingerprint sensor that works well 3) a more clear and crisp screen 4) better antennas that consistently gets better coverage.

Why you should buy the Vivo XL:
1)  It’s $50 cheaper  2) the battery life is excellent  3) a processor that runs significantly smoother

Conclusion
Aside from the differences mentioned above these phones are basically the same.  If I had to pick one, which would I buy? My money would go for the Vivo XL.  For me the battery life of the Vivo XL and the fact that it runs more smoothly in daily usage gives it the win.  Either way, you cannot lose with either of these phones.","4.0 out of 5 stars"

What I ended up purchasing this phone because of the price and reviews. I thought some how i beat the system and got a great phone for a great price.  That being said it is greatly lacking in some areas.

Pros:
Price -$200 aka a budget phone

4G lte compatible with ATT network. Just popped in the sim card and it was ready.

Really nice display!

Fingerprint sensor -The sensor is on the back of phone. I had to register both pointer fingers. It was comfortable once u get used to it.

Battery Life- DAILY light uses of instagram, snapchat, Facebook,  email, groupon surfing, amazon surfing.  (1-4 hours in transit) talk time 1-4 hours and heavy texting. Idle time was about 6-9 hours. I easily get 24 to 50 hours  without a recharge. Medium back lightlight

Decently Loud speaker

Comes with a rapid charger!

CONS!

After putting in sim card some of my contacts were missing. It was weird. It was a mixture of old and new contacts missing. Also it did not transfer over my blocked call list. :/

The OS is trashy. It is running 5.1.1  EMUI
Its just not user friendly to me... (maybe i just miss the ease of S4) it resembled iphone a bit
  All types of BLOAT WEAR that you cant remove. I downloaded a lollipop launcher. It gave me an app draw (thank goodness). But at what cost? It added MORE BLOAT WARE and random pop up advertisement. You also can't create folders without buying a prime option.
  You will have to download a better keyboard too. I think the stock one is a bit small/cramped

CAN NOT READ MEMORY CARD. I have tried to get the memory card to work multiple times..
(Might be a deal breaker if i cant get it to work)

Crappiest camera.
I thought my S4 was old but when comparing camera it easily beats this. I looked at other reviews with pictures and they looked clear. My camera is fuzzy and shows little to no details. You cant possibly take a decent selfie.

Sound quality
Call sound quality is okay. Didn't really have a problem.  Speaker phone is a little muffled.

DROPPED CALLS.
I have had multiple dropped calls with this device.  I have 5 4G bars and in the middle of talking it will just end the call.

Doesn't come with ear buds","2.0 out of 5 stars"

The Camera could be better in low light, but is stellar in better conditions.

They made radios and stereos that looked cool, had all the top features, and it was at a crazy low price.  They looked really call.  Once you bought a Sound Design Stereo you realized yes you got a lot of good looking features but once you put the stereo on you realized they were not great features.  That is how I feel about the Honor 5x Unlocked phone.  I really want to thank Huawei for letting me preview this phone.  First and foremost for 200$ and unblocked its not a bad phone if you look at it that way.  If my phone broke or I needed a phone that was not 600$ it is actually a decent option, but given the choice I don't think I will use it as my everyday phone.

Some good features to point out are the construction. It feels like a great phone, the metal construction is solid.  I like the big screen and the display also, the display is pretty sharp.  I also like the fingerprint scanner to unlock the phone.  It works well and is easy to use.  But again, a lot of this is cosmetic.  The phone looks and feels great on the outside.  My issues seem to be with the operating system and the processor.

My problem with the phone is that it just seems very slow and lagging and it does not help that it is still running snapdragon and lollipop.  Some the apps I use, for example my fitness tracker seem to take forever to sync.  The phone and its operating system just seem a bit slow and outdated for 2016.  Also, I am not a big fan of the sound quality on actually making calls, it is decent but not great.

I am not a phone expert, I am not technical.  Bottom line for 200$ it might not be a bad starter phone or replacement phone.  It has a lot of features just not a lot of up to date features in my opinion, and I am not ready to replace my Google Nexus with this phone.  It is a great looking phone on the outside but the guts of the phone, maybe with an update should be better.  Not a bad phone for 200$ bucks.  As I learn more about this phone, I will continue to update this review.

****just a quick update.  I have continued to use the phone and I will stand by my 3 star review. I have added a memory SD card and made some settings changes recommended online.  My basic premise has not changed.  Great cosmetic features like display and screen.  The battery is very strong and lasts a really long time.  However, the phone is slow in my opinion.","3.0 out of 5 stars"

Pros:
Very handsome, stately looking phone.
Good size, feels good in hand.  Light (may be negative for some people)
Bright, sharp screen.
Large battery, seems to last fairly long so far.
Fingerprint scanner works great (main reason I chose this phone)!
Great value for what you get.

Cons:
Had some issues where turning on GPS makes me lose all network connections (data, gps, phone).  Switching airplane mode on/off fixes that problem.
Feels sort of sluggish.  Many have said this is due to the underpowered CPU (SD 616) with the heavy EMUI skin.
Missing some common features that I'm used to on higher-end phones, such as gyrometer, nfc, qi charging.

Other points:
Waiting for a marshmallow update, should fix the sluggish problems I noted above.","4.0 out of 5 stars"

Cons:

Not great speed out of the box (easily fixed by tweaking performance settings)
Annoying defaults (need to ""whitelist"" apps to run in background)
No NFC (neither does any phone in price range, can't complain)

As you can see, most of the cons are software related that are easily fixed. There are a ton of reviews online that show how.

The build quality is on par with any of the flagship models from Samsung or HTC. It's hands down better than anything LG has made in recent years.

One thing to remember, this is a budget phone. But for a budget phone, you can't go wrong.

Pros:
Build Quality
Screen looks great, decent resolution
Solid back camera
Fingerprint reader works very well
Calls sound great
Reasonably speedy, again pretty darn good for something in this price range
Huawei's interface is actually rather nice, better than Samsung

Cons:
No NFC
No Wireless charging
JPGs from the camera can be muddy
No gyroscope sensor

For the cons, all but the gyroscope sensor can be forgiven. The phone has all the other usual sensors but no gyroscope. This is a sensor that has been in most phones since 2010. This sensor facilitates panoramas and photosphere photos. With that in mind, you will have use third party camera apps for panoramas and they will not be as nice as other phones with a gyroscope.

I'm a terrible person, I knocked a star off because of the gyroscope.

I am coming from a Note 4, LG G2, Nokia etc.  All good phones.  This phone deserves the 5 stars.  It does not feel cheap in any way.  Solid and metal.  Fingerprint reader and 5.5 inch good screen is the reason to buy.  Another point not talked about is that this uses a more common Snap Dragon processor that is popular in the US.  Rooting is also easy due to Huawei (Honor's parent company) giving you the key to unlock the bootloader.  If this word is unknown to you, just know that if you get into controlling your phone on a higher level it can be done.  Believe it or not, this is huge.  One of the only little gripes would be the lack of cases for the phone, but that is to be expected due to the name not well known in the West...YET.  Huawei has become the second most common handset in the East in just a few years.  It now makes the larger of the two Nexus phones.  You are looking at the next Samsung here.  Only three companies are in a position where they can manufacture, distribute the hardware (processor), handset and the software.  Apple, Samsung and Huawei.  This company will be a household name in a year here in the U.S.  Companies are already copy them (touch sensor was out prior to the Iphone on the Huawei Mate 7)  For the price this is 5 stars, if all else was equal and all phones cost exactly the same, I would say this phone is a 4 stars due to slightly older hardware.","5.0 out of 5 stars"

I have a lot of respect for how quick Huawei has been releasing security patches and Enhancement updates. Huawei has also promised to release Marshmallow and EMUI4 in the near future. The day the phone was released Huawei pushed out a security patch. Huawei is also in the process of pushing out an Enhancements software update that includes Android security patch level for January 2016, Updated honor icons and Additional enhancements (Firmware Version KIW-L24C567B140). More information can be found Club Hihonor forums.  Not to mention that the phone has only been release for a month from the time of this review. Bravo Huawei keep up the good work!

Update: 24 hours after writing the review the update was released.

Before I get into the actual review I would like to add that Huawei is asking for customer feedback and suggestions that will help improve device experience for future updates. Please do a goole search for club hihonor to register and provide feedback.  It is very important to provide this feedback so that we can continue to receive these updates. I was unable to provide links as Amazon has blocked the links.

Pros:
- Price - Hands down the best phone you can buy at 200.
- Build Quality - Not the best but not the worst either. It does not feel cheap in the hands.
- Quick OTA Updates - Honor does not have to wait for the carrier to approve the update so you will get the update once Huawei releases them.
- Fingerprint Reader - Sensor location, Speed, and accuracy are just perfect.
- 1080P IPS Display - At 401 ppi this screen is big and clear. Accurate colors. iPhones also use IPS displays over amoled.
- Battery Life - I am heavy user and easily get a full day out this phone. I can get 5-6 hours of screen on time. Very pleased with battery life.
- Camera - While not the best it takes very good pictures even under low light. Flash also works very well.
- SD card slot - Works as intended too. You can change default location to SD Card and apps, photos and videos will all install to SD card.
- Dual sim - Not something I will ever use but it’s there.
- Speakers - Again while not the best they still deserve to be in the pros list. They are loud and perfect for ringtones and notification but not good at high volume for music. They server their purpose and serve it well.
- EMUI Launcher - While a bit sluggish at the moment they have done very well with the ease of use of the launcher. Everything is though out very well. My wife can use the phone without asking me too many questions and that says a lot.
- Color Options - Phone comes in black with dark gray back cover, White with Daybreak Silver and Sunset Gold with gold back cover. Read below for more details on my favorites and least favorite.

Cons:

- No NFC - This was not an issue for me. Out of the 30 other phones I owned that had NFC I maybe used it 5 times. This may or may not be important to you.
- Sluggish Launcher - At this time the launcher is a bit sluggish. This will most likely be resolved in a future update. The phone is fast don’t get me wrong but multitasking button is slow and some apps will sometimes hang but not for long.
- No app drawer - I can adapt well to either launcher. If you hate it then install a 3rd party launcher. That is the beauty of android. However it would be nice if they included an option for both.
- No headphone included - Im not complaining for 200 bucks I see why they didn’t include them but just so people are aware I thought I would mention it.
- Charge time - The phone comes with a 1A charger and takes about 4 hours to charge from 3% to 100%. However the phone does support 2A charging and can cut down charge times in half.

Wifi - One thing I want to mention right of the bat is the phone does not support 5GHz. However is this really a bad thing like some people have mentioned? Personally I don’t think so and the reason being that 5GHz has a shorter range then 2.4GHz by far. 2.4GHz is still plenty fast but yes has more interferences then 5GHz but I personally have not had an issues with interference. Microwaves and cordless phones are the two number one major interferences on 2.4GHz but who really uses cordless phones now days?  I have a AC router that supports both 5GHz and 2.4GHz and all my devices are connected via 2.4Ghz due to the range limitation that 5GHz has. I cannot use my phone outside with 5GHz connection I have to be indoors. With 2.4 Ghz I can be at the neighbors and still get a solid connection to my wifi. Would it have been nice to have both? Sure it would but you may find your self never using it like I do. Yes there are people out there that could benefit from it in highly populated areas where interference is an issue but this should not be a deal breaker.

Price/Build Quality - At 200 dollars the phone is an absolute beast! The build quality is very nice and feels very expensive in the hand. However I would strongly recommend getting a clear silicon case to protect your investment as well as a glass screen protector as the metal back cover can scratch easily on your keys. The back cover has a plastic band on the top and bottom so the back cover is not completely metal.

OTA Updates- Huawei is pushing out updates faster than any other company I have dealt with excluding the Nexus line of phones. Huawei does not have to wait for the carrier to approve the update so you will get the update once Huawei releases them.

Fingerprint Reader - The reader works perfect. The location is absolutely perfect and feels natural in the hand. I’m certain that Apple and Samsung will soon copy the sensor location. Other phones like the iPhone and Galaxy phone that have the reader on the home button are very awkward to use. Your finger naturally rests where the sensor is located so unlocking from the pocket is a pleasure. Galaxy phones have issues with detecting your print at time. This phone works nearly every time and under 1-2 seconds. This was not something I expected from a 200 dollar phone. My only complaint is that at the moment you can only registers 5 different prints. Why do you need more you may ask? The software in EMUI allows you to open up certain apps or call a contact with an assigned print. Both mine and my wife’s prints are on my kids phones so now they are limited to only 3 prints they can use to unlock the phone and use as shortcuts.

1080P IPS Display - The 5.5 Inch 401 PPI 1080p IPS display is perfect. The screen is very detailed and colors are natural and accurate. However if you are coming from a amoled display and like bright vivid colors that amoled offers you may not like this screen right away but you will definitely get used to it. This is more of a personal preference. Touch responsiveness is perfect even with a glass screen protector. The screen gets very bright outdoors and so far I have no complaints about the screen what so ever. Watching YouTube videos and viewing pictures has been a pleasure.

Battery Life - The phone has a 3000 mAh battery. This is probably the best feature the phone has to offer. I’m a very heavy user and have not owned a phone that can get me through a full day. I’ve had to resort to a external power supply that I took everywhere. I no longer have to carry around the extra power supply with this phone and can easily get 5-6 hours of screen on time. I owned a Oppo Find 7a and loved it because of the large 5.5 inch screen. The downside was the battery life but the phone had quick charging and sort of made up for it. However with this phone the quick charging is not needed as it will get you through the whole day. My wife that is not a heavy user can go two days without a charge. The phone actually uses the more expensive Lithium Polymer (Lipo) vs Lithium Ion battery.

Camera - While not the best it takes very good pictures even under low light. Other phones that I have owned and compared to have to use flash to get a decent picture under low light. This phone did not have to use the flash to get a decent picture under low light settings. The shutter is very fast and so far has taken less blurry photos than 95% of all the phones that I have owned excluding the Galaxy S6, iPhone 6s, and LGG4 (all flash ship phones of course). My daughter is 13 years old and her whole life is around social media and picture taking. She chose the Honor 5x over the Galaxy S6 mainly because of battery life and the location of the figure print scanner. She used both phones for a few days and said she could barely tell the different in the photos. I personally can see that the photos on the Galaxy S6 were way better but to a 13 year old kid they would prefer battery life and a bigger screen over better photos and faster phone. She was unable to tell Galaxy S6 had better camera, Processor and screen then the Honor 5x. I then sold the Galaxy s6 and purchased 3 more Honor 5x's for all my kids for the price of one Galaxy S6.

SD card slot - Works as intended too. You can change default location to SD Card and apps, photos and videos will all install to SD card. Other phones I have owned had an SD card slot but would only allow you to use it for photos and videos. It would not install app on the SD card like the Honor 5x does. I purchased a 32gb SD card and have installed a ton of games, apps, photos and videos on the SD card without any issues. Simply go into settings>Storage and change default location to SD Card.

Dual sim - Not something I will probably ever use but its there. You have an option for a Micro sim card and nano sim card. This would be very useful if you own a business and need two lines. One for personal calls and other for business.

Speakers - Again while not the best they still deserve to be in the pros list. If you compare to Galaxy S6 or HTC speakers then yes they suck. However if you are comparing to 95% of the speakers on the market they are loud and perfect for ringtones, notifications, and videos. They are not very good for music at high volumes but I don’t know a lot of people that listen to music from there tiny little phone speaker. Most of us have Bluetooth speakers for that. The speakers serve there purpose and serve it well for a 200 dollar phone. Even more expensive phones have a worse speakers then the Honor 5x.

Charge time - The phone comes with a 1A charger and takes about 4 hours to charge from 3% to 100%. However the phone does support 2A charging so if you have a 2A charger on hand you can cut the charge time in half. 2A charging is also a verified feature on the Honor 5x website so it is perfectly safe to use a 2A charger. Again they most likely sent a 1A vs 2A charger to cut back on cost.

Color Options - Phone comes in black with dark gray back cover, White with Daybreak Silver and Sunset Gold with gold back cover. Out of the three the black with dark gray back was my favorite. One thing I noticed right away with the White and Gold model is the black border around the LCD. The black model still has the black border but because the front bezel is also black the border was hidden. I have taken pictures side by side so you can see what im talking about. The white was my 2nd favorite and probably would have been my first pick had they done a better job tucking in the LCD border behind the bezel. As for the gold model I did not like it at all. It does not even appear gold and at times looks like a rose gold on the back cover. The front looks more like a copper color than gold. It not horrible or unbearable but it was just the least favorite out of the three for me but my son loves it so thats all that matters.

EMUI Launcher/OS - Launchers are a big subject for me because I have dealt with some crappy launchers such as Touchwiz for the Galaxy phones and ColorOS for Oppo phones. EMUI reminds me a lot of ColorOS however the EMUI 3.1 launcher was thought out very well and works way better. I didn’t like that the app drawer was gone it reminded me to much of iOS but quickly got used to it. The OS is still a bit sluggish at the moment taking some apps 1-2 seconds to open at times but I have confidence that Honor will resolve this very soon as this is more of an optimization of the OS vs and launcher issue. The processor is definitely capable of providing a smooth experience it just needs to be optimized so I hope they work on this first. My wife can use the phone without asking me too many questions and that says a lot.

Overall I am very happy with this phone. Not only because it was cheap but because it was very well designed and built. Nothing feels cheap about this phone. I have paid 300 more for phones that I was not happy with. Honor has definitely raised the bar for budgets phones pressing other companies to follow the trend. I would definitely recommend this phone for anyone looking for a better than average phone on a budget.

Update: Since the recent update KIW-L24C567B140 the phone performs very well now.  However there are two settings that greatly effected performance. When enabling Guest Mode via Settings>Security>Privacy Protection from phone settings menu the phone takes a major performance hit. Apps would hang, at times 10 secs or more to open up the camera shutter button, and icons were missing from home screen and slowly start to appear. However once Guest Mode/Privacy Protection was turned off the phone performed very well. Changing power saving mode from Smart (Factory Default) to Normal also increased performance via Settings>Power Saving. I still also got a full days worth of battery life! I hope that an update will resolve this.

Tips:

Move multiple icons at once - I took me a while to realize that this was possible but from your home screen you can pinch the screen to bring up the Home Page setting options. You can add wallpapers, Widgets, change page transitions effects and access the More Settings page to change home page settings. Once you have pinched the screen can start to select the icons you wish to move. You will see a blue check mark on the icons you wan to move. Once you are read to move the icons long hold on any one of the blue checked apps you have selected and move the icons. However folders are limited to 30 apps :-(

Guest Mode - Pretty cool feature but as stated above this feature really effected the performance of the phone. To enable go to Settings>Security>Privacy Protection and click Lets Start. Enter your main pass code and press next. This should bring you to the Owners Fingerprint screen, do nothing here but press next. You will then be prompted to enter a guest pass code, enter a pass code different from your main pass code. You should now be a the Guest Fingerprint screen, from here you can add a new print or assign an existing print for guest mode. You should now be at the Privacy Protection screen main menu where you can now hide contact, photo albums and hide certain application from the quest account.

Notification no longer working? - Ok so EMUI OS will not allow apps to run in the background unless you say otherwise a feature I actually enjoy this may be why the battery life is so good. This will prevent apps like Facebook, Ebay, Facebook Messenger, Spotify, YouMail, Netflix and Dropbox from working correctly and will also prevent push notifications. Example: Spotify and Netflixs will enable a quick menu on your lock screen and notification bar to pause, play and forward music or movies. However if you do not allow the app to run in the background the app will close out once you lock your screen. Another example if Facebook. If someone messages you or if you get an update on Facebook your phone will not notify you until you allow it run in the back ground. If you are having issue with any app try this first. Go to Settings>Protected Apps> and enable all the apps you wish to receive real time notification and any app you wish to run in the background.

Tired of the Power Consumption Prompt? I got sick of being reminded that certain apps were consuming a lot of power. To disable the prompts go to Settings>Power Saving>Settings and disable Power intensive prompt.","5.0 out of 5 stars"

Need a bigger screen for my eyes (aging) and wanted more power.  Tried Moto X Unlimited (poor signal) and LG G3 factory unlocked (poor signal, only EDGE!, too much bloatware that interferes with basic operations and can't get rid of) and returned both.  Honor 5X picked up 4G LTE from the initial power on with a StraightTalk SIM card - love it.  Minimal bloatware that can be easily removed.  Very nice screen; movies look great.  I like the software - easy to use and smooth.  Dual-SIM and SD card slot is nice.  Fingerprint sensor is surprisingly accurate and fast.  Camera is excellent in daylight but mediocre/a little noisy for darker shots; has nice camera features - I'm fine with it though.  Bluetooth linked up to my car and Garmin Forerunner 920XT easily.  Drawbacks: WON'T allow wi-fi hotspot, phone sound is not great but acceptable.  I love the magnifier software- allows me to read without my reading glasses!  This sub-$200 phone beats the $400+ phones I've tried. It also comes with a screen protector already on the screen so no need to buy one and wasting time and aggravation trying to install a 3rd party bubble-free protector- nice touch!  I'll keep this one and use the Moto G as a backup.  Very happy ...so far.","5.0 out of 5 stars"

For starters, I use the Twilight app (an app that adapts to the time of day and promotes healthy sleeping. Normally, the app runs in the background, and I never had to manually turn the app on every time I used my phone. After downloading and using the app on the Honor, every time my phone goes to sleep, I have to go into the app to turn it on every time I use my phone---to say the least, I'm annoyed. I also drive frequently to commute to work. With the S4, when I got in to my car, my phone would automatically be picked up and connected via bluetooth. With the Honor, nothing. I have to go in to my phone settings every time just to listen to Pandora or speak to a person when in dial mode. On top of that, if I left the car briefly while Pandora would be on (or turned the engine off mid-listening to music), when I try to start Pandora up, the app would continue to loop and restart before the first song could play. I tested the app on various different phones because I thought it was the app itself, but it is the phone. Something about cutting off connection or walking away during use of the app, disrupts something between the bluetooth and app itself. Thus, I had to delete the app several times and reinstall just to have it running normally.

To say the least, I'll be returning this phone and going back to my S4--which lags a lot less than the Honor CPU does--and this is surprising because it is running less apps (the minimal) than my S4 had and unable to do so at a decent speed. Sigh. Too bad.","2.0 out of 5 stars"

What I wanted was a substitute phone that would allow me to buy my own sim and minutes and decide just how much time/data I needed without another bill coming. In terms of data minutes I'm not sure it saves that much (depending on your plan), but when it comes to not getting another monthly bill, amen.

First of all, the phone has a very substantial feel. I had a Samsung s5 and, to be honest, for what I'm using this for (I'm not an app hog, most of what I use is basic and most is related to photography) and I really don't see a major difference between the two (again, in terms of what I use it for--taking pictures, talking and Google searches at my local cafe). After seeing several reviews from CES (all of which were pretty good), I decided it was worth testing.

I'm a photographer and while I don't shoot that much with a cell camera, this 13mp camera is great. I got tons of banding in the sky (particularly in lowlight with the S5) and I get almost none with this. I'm not sure if that's a chip thing (I think so) or a software thing, or both. But either way, the camera is very good quality--and let's face it, with some of the photo apps out there, it's the gateway to doing almost anything you want (including time-lapse, which I love).  Also the screen quality is superb. Funny, because I had read some bad reviews of other phones from the parent company of Honor and so I wasn't expecting much, but the screen quality is great.

Some other reviewers (here and elsewhere) have talked about the difficulty of having to kick-start certain apps each time you use them, or to go hunt for them, but so far everything I've set up seems to be right there. But I'm not 15, so shuffling through apps is not second nature to me and I'm probably plodding along at a far slower speed in locating them than I need to regardless of what phone I'm using.

Anyway, the phone is still pretty new to me, but I have to think that considering the price, the quality of the screen and the camera and the ability to buy my own time, this is a pretty respectable phone. As soon as I get a half dozen decent photos, I'll post a little gallery (here and on my main site).","4.0 out of 5 stars"

It packs in loads of features at a very affordable price. I bought three at launch and have not been disappointed.

Hardware:  Good quality metal body housing a big and bright screen. The blacks are not as dark as one would like but still looks good. The expandable micro SD slot loaded in an old card well. Be aware that this phone prefers the high-speed card so if you're looking, make sure to filter to that. The phone is 5.5"" and coming from a 4.7"" Moto X (1st gen), I'm still adjusting to the size.  The metal body is slippery so I'm currently searching for a good case.

Software:  Huawei's Emotion User Interface (EMUI) is rather snappy. It zips around from app to app in a rather quick manner. There are times when the app stalls, as if to think about what to do, but it's rare and often quickly remedied.  My largest gripe is that free RAM is often much lower than the 2 GB limit.  I'm often at less than 1GB of free RAM and I just feel as if the phone is inefficient.  The absence of an app drawer is also missed. Users are relegated to creating folders and accessing all apps from there. It took me an entire week to customize but my phone is finally where I want it to be.

Phone Reception:  The phone speaker, is indeed, rather hard to hear out of sometimes. It's not my network either. When using a bluetooth headset, the calls are clear.  I'm using T-mobile, moving over from Sprint and I miss Sprint's HD voice to other Sprint users. This is a network issue and unrelated to the phone itself.

Other media features like FM Radio, Recorders, and video playback etc.. are all top notch.  The phone is an uncompromising offer. The fingerprint scanner is the most underrated feature. I thought I'd barely use it but I hate entering a password now.  You can store up to five fingerprints so you can unlock the phone in either hand or by other people.  You can even lock e-commerce app transactions behind a fingerprint scan.  I confidently recommend this phone.","5.0 out of 5 stars"

I do like the fingerprint unlock feature a lot. I like how big the screen is. The battery life is pretty decent.

I had my ASUS Zenfone 2 for a year or more and it's camera is AMAZING, this one isn't even comparable. Honestly I hate this camera. The placement of the keys on my old phone have me spoiled, I lock the screen on this phone unintentionally so often it drives me nuts.

I have said repeatedly that I hate this phone, but it's only because I'm comparing it to the ASUS Zenfone 2. I will be giving this phone to my husband and spending the extra money for my old one. He likes phone and his is getting old.","4.0 out of 5 stars"

The Good: I started personalizing the phone right away and was able to put my old sim card ($100 a year GoPhone) into it after I trimmed the sim down.  Hurrah!!! Also quickly and easily linked up to my WIFI network, which I intend to use for internet for the time being until I see how much I want to use data on the new phone.  That probably sounds crazy to those addicted to their smart phones for everything, but for someone who only occasionally used her flip phone, it's a logical first step that doesn't require a big investment (just the new phone).  I'm thrilled with how easy it is to text and, since I have over $300 of unused talk/text minutes, the fact it costs a lot for each text doesn't matter to me -- they are free since they just use my rollover balances. The fingerprint sensor is great (I took some online advice and registered as many fingers as the phone would allow) and the latest software update (which I did as soon as I linked to WIFI) is quick and gives you a screen similar to other Android devices (apparently the Honor 5X used to show something else).  I was also able to download a detailed users manual for the Honor 5X and am walking my way through it as I learn my new phone.  Other than the fact the manual doesn't tell me to double tap to save my choice of wallpaper (I single tapped numerous times and failed before thinking of that), the instructions are clear and helpful.  I also linked the phone to my car after a couple of false starts (had forgotten I needed to make the phone blue tooth visible, which is under settings, and which I did on my last phone four years ago, so had forgotten).  That's my fault, not the phone's, and it worked easily once I made it visible.

Getting back to the screen protector, after using the phone for a few minutes the screen was covered in my fingerprints.  I tried wiping them off and they tended to smear and were really hard to remove.  I looked online and learned this was a common issue and some suggested just taking off the protector, cleaning the actual screen (easier), and getting a better screen protector online.  That's what I'm in the process of doing, but I sure wish the phone had come with something better to start with.  Note: After I removed the protector, realized I wasn't comfortable putting the phone in my handbag to go out, since I feared scratching the screen.  So I re-cleaned the actual screen, then re-attached the factory-provided screen protector (only thing I have until the new one arrives).  It was difficult to re-attach, lots of bubbles.  I worked on it for a while and reduced the bubbles, then gave up since I know I'm just going to remove it again in a few day to put on the new one. Whole thing is a definite pain in the neck. So that is a definite area for improvement for the next version of the Honor 5X.

Otherwise, it's terrific!","4.0 out of 5 stars"

The phone is very nice, has a beautiful clear crisp screen resolution, it's light and has a shiny metal back. It has a high-end look and feel with many great features. Excellent camera. The screen is actually a 5"" rather than 5.5"", as the home buttons are on the actual screen rather than on the frame of the phone. So your actual browsing window is smaller. But there were real problems: right away the most annoying thing was the auto brightness that could not be disabled. The screen was dim every time the phone was awaken, and I had to disable the auto brightness (which was not bright at all), only for it to revert to auto the next time. I had to download an app that controlled screen brightness. But I could have lived with it. The critical part was Bluetooth that kept turning itself off at random throughout the day. Sometimes it turned itself off after just a few minutes, other times after an hour or two. It did not disconnect from a particular device (so you may think it's the device's fault) but rather Bluetooth was inexplicably OFF! Having the phone connected by Bluetooth to my VTech cordless home phone is essential, as I have no land line and only rely on cell phone with steady bluetooth connection. I wish it didn't have that problem, as I really wanted to keep it.","3.0 out of 5 stars"

This phone for being a unlocked phone is awesome. At $199.99 it is a great value for a dual sim unlocked device. It runs Android lollipop, has a 8 core processor, 2GB of ram, 2 sim slots which can do both AT&T and T-Mobile sim cards in either one. Metal on the outside is nice and durable but may tend to bend in some instances.

Improvements:
- Camera does sometime take photos indoors that are somewhat blurry
- Battery could have been just a bit bigger.
- UI is beautiful but it could be a bit more optimized

Overall: Good phone at a solid price but could use some improvements to make it even better.

Note*: Only one sim slot is LTE while the other one is 2G, both can be used for LTE as well but like I said before only 1 at a time can be used for LTE. There is no Dual LTE sim slots on this phone.","3.0 out of 5 stars"

The option to tether exists in the software - but when you enable tethering, the system checks with the carrier to see if you have that service?  I think the only way around this is rooting the phone. However, I have not tried this and I don't know for sure if rooting will work.  (note, I have tried USB tethering and tethering via Bluetooth, too.  Nothing is working.

Note: I would pay more for tethering - but this phone is not supported by Cricket.

I have tethered on every phone prior to this Honor 5x.  I am guessing this is a trend with phones today.  I have read the Nexus phones are behaving the same way and making it difficult to tether.  It's an important feature for me - so I will probably return this and buy an older phone I know will work with Cricket tethering.

There seems to be little doubt, to me at least, that this is a top-drawer, quality phone that has been deeply discounted to both attract a consumer user base and draw the rave reviews it is presently receiving. The absence of commonly complained about features like NFC, a USB-C charger, a slightly outmoded processor and the like are just enough to keep the phone within the mid-range pricing category but not enough to dismiss all the other attributes that make this an outstanding phone as well as an outstanding bargain.

Although most of the hoopla has centered around the superlative fingerprint scanner and the quality 1080p screen, I think the real build quality of the phone lies in its lesser, standard features like the FM radio, Mp3 music and MP4 video player, along with the excellent built-in flashlight, calculator and calendar. The FM radio, for example, is stronger and cleaner than the transmitter on both the Sony Walkman cassette player and the Xperia M that I own. Ditto for the MP3 player. And with an SD card (I'm hanging with a 64gb right now) you can have a film library of at least 30 on board movies at your fingertips that run crisply and cleanly on the 1080p screen. All in all, it's an impressive media experience.

Some sissy reviewers have complained about the default Emotion UI, but that seems to be because they want the perfect immediate experience and they despise when they aren't instantly gratified. But if you tinker with the EMUI and you kind of see what Huawei is getting at, and anticipate where the may be headed with its development, you can kind of sense that it isn't all that problematical. I, for one, don't see the need for either a third-party launcher or an app drawer. But then again, I've never owned an iPhone so this UI looks pretty fresh to me. What I am especially finding intriguing and enjoyable is playing with and tweaking and finding ways to make EMUI compatible with my visual aesthetic, which mostly consists of viewing the many different themes available on Huawei's website and selecting the best one.

I haven't tried the highly touted and versatile fingerprint scanner since the very cool double-tap feature suits me just fine for now. That, and all the other features of this phone, will likely implemented in due course. But for now, discovering all the things this phone can do has been interesting and fun.","5.0 out of 5 stars"

First, I'd like to commend Huawei for putting together a device with a great price for the features you get. The EMUI skin is great, probably my favorite skin to date (I've used TouchWiz, LG UI, and Motoblur). The 1080p screen was average at best, but I did like the built in scree protector being a thing (but not the reason). My favorite feature was the fingerprint sensor. It just works, and it works much better than my Note 4 did.

But unfortunately the pros end fairly short, but for most people it'll do the job. On the software end, the notification center and 'protected apps' were more hassle than it was worth. Apps without ""protection"" would get force closed, often - and there was no warning. For days I was wondering why I wasn't getting notifications for anything, and this was because all the relevant apps were being force closed - including their services. The notification center breaks Pandora (it's been acknowledged and they're working on a software update to fix it, supposedly).

As for hardware cons, the phone doesn't support 5GHz WiFi nor does it have NFC. Both features I assumed would be in it (which was my mistake). It's a shame it didn't have either of those features. It also doesn't have an IR transmitter, a feature I don't expect in ever phone but forgot to check in this one - not a real con, just putting it out there. The camera on this phone is also terrible, the rear facing camera is about as good as a webcam.

But the biggest issue with the phone - and the reason I returned it - is bluetooth compatibility. The bluetooth is a little spotty on my headset, not gamebreaking. But an absolute nightmare in my car - absolutely unusable. Constant pauses during music - and the music doesn't pause, just the data from the bluetooth. It also never worked with my Pebble Smartwatch. It would pair fine, say it's connected, but I would rarely get notifications. I do not know if I got a dud or if there is a major software issue, but I can't sacrifice those two items for this one.","3.0 out of 5 stars"

Nothing to write home about. The design and build of the phone lead you to expect more out of this device but it's not a smart phone competitor imo. Everyone is saying ""for 200$ you get a a flawless finger print scanner and aluminum body"" but what is is that if you have to sacrifice performance. This phone reminds me of the phones in 2010 as far as performance goes. There a good amount of lag when jumping in and out of apps.. Also app load ups take a few seconds (1-3 sec) and lag presses can be annoying. I found this improved a bit when down loading Google launcher. Speaker on this phone is not great and not horrible, but when using it in phone calls I found myself trying to make out what the person was trying most the time. Screen quality and resolution are pretty good and I won't complain (I'm coming from using a note 5) And lastly the camera is disappointing.. It works well in bright areas or day time but low light is horrible and grainy. I know people are gonna say ""what more do you want for 200$"" and my response would be.. Instead of sacrificing performance why not cut back on build quality and finger print scanner. Everyone uses phone case and screen protectors these days and build quality is rarely an issue unless you're paying 800$ for a phone. Then I can understand wanting a more premium feeling phone.

I would recommend this phone to someone who is doesn't care about lag, looking for a phone to hold them over until they get a new phone, or just care about pricing. Overall it's a decent phone and I feel with some updates it can be a real contender and is probably among the better of budget phones. I plan to keep this phone as a spare.","3.0 out of 5 stars"

Decided to go with the 5x for the higher resolution and fingerprint scanner. Beautiful build. Have gotten many complements on it. The skinned ui was surprisingly easy to use once you get over that there is no app drawer. If you want the drawer, installing the Google now launcher is easy enough. The 2gbs of RAM hasn't been an issue. Wish the memory was larger but can always add an SD card. The LCD panel is beautiful to look at. If amoled (at 720p) and 3gbs of RAM is more important go for the Vivo 5. Either phone is fully worth the $200 price tag.","5.0 out of 5 stars"

We are on no-contract service with an AT&T MVNO and it was just a matter of swapping the SIM card and updating the APN info in the network settings.

The phone is fast; it still hiccups on resource intensive tasks but overall is a huge leap forward from my outdated Galaxy S4 and a nice upgrade from the Alcatel Idol OneTouch 3 that my husband was using.

Battery life is good, generally with light usage I can get 2 days before needing to charge.  It has a fairly effective task killer built in, but you may want to ""protect"" apps that you use often so they do not terminate when the screen goes off, or you may use more battery re-loading the app over and over again coming out of sleep.

Aesthetically this phone is fantastic, I would believe it was made by HTC if not for the branding.

Screen is good, though the auto-brightness seems to glitch now and again and go fully dim when I need it to be bright.  I just sleep, and then unlock again with fingerprint reader and it corrects itself; this takes maybe 2 seconds.

The EMUI software may be nice for some, I immediately replaced it with Google Now launcher.

The cameras are great for a budget phone, not amazing compared to phones that closer to 4 digits.  Overall, I am pleased, but I won't be throwing away my DSLR anytime soon.

In summary, this is a good budget phone and I would recommend it for AT&T MVNOs or prepaid over anything they are offering in store today.","5.0 out of 5 stars"

I bought this smartphone because my kid needed a phone.  I already have a note 4. When this arrived in the mail one day early  I saw the box and said to myself wow nice looking box. Then I proceeded to open it up and I had that same feeling I had when I first got cable modem service and went from 56k internet speed to 10mb download speed. I was amazed at how premium metal looking sleek looking it was. Then I said let me try my SIM card out. I did and powered this up and immediately it had an update that downloaded I live in the Bronx my and T-Mobile speeds in my area is second to none. Average download of 90mbs. This thing got that and more. It picked up the T-Mobile LTE bands that I needed even though it's missing band 12. I have not had any issues. Needless to say I kept this device for myself and have my kids the note 4. I have been asked by Co workers what kind of phone this is and they are totally surprised when I tell them the price. This thing is an absolute steal for 199. What in the world are you waiting for. I am going to order a few more. Just to have and sell for maybe a few dollars more. The only issue I have had is on the second day I had the phone after updating it I turnesit off and when it tried to reach start it went into an endless boot loop for hours. Finally got it to turn off and left it off a ND when I turned back in an hour later it started back up no problem and I have not turned it off since. Don't know if that's a flaw in the software but I will keep watching it.","4.0 out of 5 stars"
