There has been a lot of hype about this device. The design was sleek for a $150 phone. I figure give it a try.
The phone came nicely wrapped in a nice little box with a pair of headphones, a flip cover case, and a charger (alot to add for a $150 phone). The phone felt nice in the hand..
Then I turned it on. The resolution was OK. The screen although 5.2  was swallowed by the bezels and the size of the phone. The camera was OK. Everything was... Ok. Nothing was necessarily bad just not a superb experience as I was expecting. I would recommend this for anyone that doesn't know that much about Android or just entering the Android world or for a parent that is getting a child there first phone. But from an experienced Android user I wasn't super impressed. Will not be used as my daily driver","4.0 out of 5 stars"

1. Extremely good value for money. I paid $100 for this in April (no, not an April fool's joke).
2. Almost native Android 5.1. Minimal bloatware.
3. Has band 12. I have a OnePlus One and that does not give me 4G data when I am in some parts of the country. Also, the OPO had poor mobile data speeds in the UK. This phone works for those purposes quite well.
4. Dual band and the included SIM toolkit app does a good job at delegating activities to one SIM. When traveling in the UK, I had data through my T-Mobile SIM and phone calls through my Lyca mobile UK SIM
5. MicroSD expandable.
6. FM Radio - insert included earphones or your own earphones and you can listen to FM radio. This comes in handy especially when traveling or when at gyms that route TV audio through FM radio stations.
7. Comes with a very decent accessory pack including earphones and a portfolio like case.
8. For the money I paid, a brilliant screen.
9. Customer service located in the US and answers the phone.

Cons:
1. Biggest con is the battery charging ability. The included charger only goes at 1ma and this isn't changed even when you attempt to use a higher charging capacity charger. It takes me about 2.5h to go from 30% to 100%.
2. Mediocre Camera. The camera does a decent job but don't expect a flagship camera quality. The front camera does have flash though. The camera overall has poor performance in not well lit shots.
3. Audio quality is not the greatest. You cannot hear the phone when on speaker. Being that the speaker is placed on the rear end of the phone, you better place the phone on its front if you don't wake up easily with alarms.
4. Not so great battery life. My Screen on Time with Bluetooth and location on is about 3.5h which is good but not great.
5. BLU is not known to update software on their phone so I don't expect to see Android 6 on this phone. Also, these phones don't enjoy much patronage in the Custom OS world.
6. While it has 2GB RAM, it isn't as snappy as some of the flagship 2GB RAM phones like the Nexus 5X.
7. Only noteworthy OS related issue - when you restart the phone, it reverts to the Default sound settings. I have had an instance of restarting my phone during a meeting only to receive sound notifications when I had prior to switching off phone set it at ""meeting"" under the notifications.
Things it does not have have which I don't necessarily consider to be a disadvantage:
1. Does not have WiFi AC support.
2. No NFC
3. No front facing speakers

In short, great value for money. With a dual SIM, FM radio and support for band 12, hard to find a better phone for the frequent American Traveler.","4.0 out of 5 stars"

I wish I had done that before. I think the people who are  commenting on this phone just received it.. But they should wait at least a month or so before rating it.. The camera is great, everything else is terrible.. Firstly the flashlight and the camera flash just stop working  whenever I try to reset the camera to see if that would help it jump right back to the home screen.. It jump back to the home screen when am in my gallery, messages & everywhere.. I cannot store picture, music  on my SD card everything is stored on the phone & that make the phone move extremely slow. If I unstalled an app the space on the phone is not freed..

The headset and charger are not really great quality will get damaged easily, also the included screen protector is a bit smaller than the face of the device. It makes applying it a bit difficult, since it does not line up exactly.The included wallet case is superb though, allows immediate functionality from the window (answer, end calls and toggle through music) and has the sleep and wake feature. Camera (Front is 5MP and with flash, selfie's are awesome) (Rear is 13MP and really comparable to the huge brands).

It came on time and the screen looks amazing and the gorilla glass is a nice touch to it. The screen is very vibrant and the colors look really great. its looks like the screen is an amoled display but its not. the case it comes with is nice looking but my only complaint with that is when the cover is closed it dont go all the way to the side of the phone prolly bc of the pu leather and the way the increase is but all in all its a nice case. the downfall i have on the phone is YES the screen is very sensitive to the touch. when i am txting and i goto the mojis and i scroll through it everytime i lift my finger then back onto the screen to scroll down again it puts that moji in the text line...so yes very sensitive. To bad that i cant use it as my daily phone because my area dont have much of any coverage in my area with T-mobile or At&t so im screwed on that and i didnt know that till i activated my phone with service. It would go in and out of service alot and had to shut the phone off to reboot the system to gain service again. Ill be using it soon though due to me moving out of this area anyways. Its worth for what the price is on the phone. The camera is pretty good. Its not the greatest but its does take some good pics for it being 13megapixels. i love the 5.2 inch display on it. i also have the Blu Dash M 5.0 and the life one x beats the other phone by far.","5.0 out of 5 stars"

However I am going to have to return it as I have some problems with it that are rendering it unusable for me.

The AUX has something wrong with it. With headphones and speakers it's fine, but when it's plugged into bigger speakers like my car stereo there is a loud static noise constantly buzzing in the background and lower/heavier sounds get distorted and poppy like a damaged record. Piano for example sounds like S***. No other device I have used with my car stereo has had this problem so it's definitely something to do with the device itself. It's not just a faulty phone either, I exchanged it and it still doesn't work. It's subtle most of the time and I could live with it but...

Time to talk about the battery. The life itself is good. But the charge time? Awful.. I'm not asking for the supercharge 20 minutes from 0 to full like the top of the line phones. But 2 hours for 50%? That was out of the box. I've been using it for about a week now and been downloading more apps and stuff is downloading over WiFi while its charging so its actually LOSING battery while its charging. About 1% per minute... I had to power it off as it was just going to die anyway.

It could be a great phone. But these two problems are making it unusable for me. Maybe somebody who does less on their phone will find a better use for it but since they're being more and more a part of human lifestyle this is unacceptable =/","2.0 out of 5 stars"

I was changing platforms back to an Android and didn't want to get locked in by AT&T so hunted for a decent unlocked phone. I even considered refurb. My only complaints is the apparent lack of image stabilization in the camera (or it is just not as good as others), and the fairly cheesy portfolio case it comes with (grandma might like it). Other than that, it is a very solid phone capable. The non-replaceable battery will annoy some people, but it easily gets me through a full day with bluetooth running (vivosmart)> I only wish I would have got it during the $99 sale. The pending Vivo 5 is supposed to be about $50 more and may be worth waiting for if your in the market. $150 is easier to part with than getting locked in by AT&T and ending up paying $450 for a phone I want to replace in 2 years.

Losing a star
-5 months into 2016 and that promise of marshmallow in early 2016 is fading fast. Sales talk..
-they are absolute silent on their facebook pages and other outlets other than pushing more product. Miami HQ? That is hard to believe
-the camera quality is probably the biggest let down. Images lack sharp details, motion blur is a constant issue.

The screen is absolutely GORGEOUS. It takes great pictures, and looks very sleek and high-quality. But there are some apparent issues that we didn't want to deal with:

Phone runs a little hot. I've had bad experiences with hot Android phones in the past, and just the fact that both of the phone's were running hot was enough for me to return it. My phone also came with a minor cracked LCD under the glass. Immediately I lost trust in Blu, and am returning these phones for a Moto G 3rd gen.

So to sum it all up for potential buyers:

Pros:

Jaw droppingly good screen
Great battery life
Light, but feels good in hand
4G and packed full of features
I enjoyed the added case

Cons:

Has good benchmarks, but something just isn't right with the performance. The phone glitches and freezes doing random tasks such as browsing and even in the settings menu. I didn't like this.

Both of our phones ran hot. You can feel it towards the top. Bummer.

My screen came damaged. Not sure if this is isolated, but it still isn't good.

The elegant design and crisp LCD screen are the two main feature that I appreciate the most. This phone also has dual sim capability which is very useful and convenient if you travel internationally or if you have two phone numbers such as personal and business number. This phone 16GB storage is expandable with microSD (which is my main dissatisfaction with iPhone that iPhone internal storage can't be expanded). This BLU Life One X phone is also unlocked so you can use it with your existing plan (e.g. AT&T, T-Mobile, etc). This BLU Life One X phone has 2GB RAM which is good enough to run multiple apps and play games (clash of clans, etc).  This BLU Life One X phone reminded me of Oneplus One+ phone which is also a great phone (albeit much more expensive). A plastic screen protector and nice flip case for this phone with a window in front to view time/date/notification is included. Adjusting to this phone keyboard (vs iPhone keyboard) will take some time (not sure if it is this phone specifically or android phones in general). Also adjusting to the android OS and interface will take time to get used to if you are used to iPhones.  There are a lot more things you can customize with android phones (widgets, etc).  One thing I haven't been able to figure out is how to turn off the vibration feature when I type on the keyboard. If anyone know please let me know. All in all BLU Life One X is a great budget smartphone.","5.0 out of 5 stars"

I cant have a ""Verified Purchase"" as I bought it trough an outside service because the item isn't shipped to Honduras.

Anyways... the phone is almost perfect! I've had it for a few hours and I already love it, its so fast, it doesnt lag for anything, great screen, perfect size and oh so elegant looks.

The bad sides at least on my unit... it overheats fast while playing games, the battery doesnt last as much as all the hype ive read, from 65% (it shipped like that) to 0% took only 4 hours... i must admit i used it a lot, but... i think it was a fast drain and finally while the screen is great, the whites have this minimal yellowish tint that even when is like almost nothing still bothers me.

Still, this phone deserves the whole 5 stars... for $99 (got it on the day it was released) i cant really expect this much of a smartphone, BLU did it great this time.

After install I looked in storage and the internal sd was empty except for the system files and ALL apps etc was on the SD card.
That's pretty cool and is a feature of Android 6, they must have back ported that feature..

Not sure if people know a update is available that addresses the slow charging.
It might not automatically notify you so you just need to go to settings, the about phone and pick the wireless update option and check for a update.

Sure the touch screen is not as nice as a 600+ dollar phone, but guess what you can get 4 of these for cost of one iPhone 6.

PROS:
- screen is beautiful, especially after you edit its  colors in settings
- battery life is great, around 4.5hrs screen on time
- stock android pretty much, can uninstall the 3-4 bloat apps
- easily unlockable bootloader and root, like a nexus
- cameras are great in good light. Low light is fine, nothing great
- premium feel, metal edge and leather feeling back, curved screen edges like iPhone. Feels like a $300-400 phone
- very fast and responsive. It does all the tasks I did on my nexus 6 at same speed if not a little faster. I know, it makes no sense
CONS
- no nfc, not a big deal for me since I don't use it
- battery takes forever to charge. Around 4 hours from 0-100. Thank god it lasts all day
- low light pics are not very good or visible

So conclusion: pretty much prefect phone. It's my go to recommendation now for anyone who wants a new phone and doesn't want to spend $400+. Get it, you won't regret it. I say it's essentially an android version of an iPhone 6. I got it for $99 but even for $149 its a steal.","5.0 out of 5 stars"

So simple to set up and absolutely unlocked. Pop the sim card, log in with Google, and you're done. Battery life is very fair.
2GB Ram is PLENTY for multitasking and the phone has little to NO BLOATWARE. iphone 6 only has 1GB RAM so go figure!

This phone has pleased me very much. The signal reception is high quality.
I love the fact that I can have an AFFORDABLE and QUALITY Phone.

Screen is beautiful. We put it side by side a Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge and the quality of the video at some points looked much cleaner.
5.2"" screen is wonderful
Comfortable to fit with one hand use and large enough for two hands.
All buttons are neatly placed on one side and is distinguishable to the touch.
ULTRA THIN
ULTRA LIGHT
Under daily usage you can't tell it's a phone with that price.
This phone FEELS as if it's AT LEAST $300 dollar value.
American Made - love it because it means to me bringing jobs back to the local economy.

with all great things there are a few shortcomings:
Loud speaker has a ""tinny"" sound.
Bluetooth is not too strong
free headset sounds muffled to the call recipient

With all that said, there's hardly any reason why spending an auto payment and leasing a phone makes any sense.

You get an awesome screen that is quite bright. You get almost stock Android Lollipop. I only had to remove an antivirus app that came preinstalled. There was one other thing but I can't remember but I am grateful for being able to take off what I didn't want. The default mail app is Boxer which isn't bad. Touchpal 2015 is the default keyboard and ASOP keyboard comes with the phone. It is easy enough to go to the Play store and download the Google keyboard or any other you want. I have had sporadic lag with the keyboard regardless of which one I used. That was mostly as the phone was setting up and I was downloading my apps and right now I have not had a repeat of the issue. If you type a lot it would be quite annoying if it remains a constant problem. I will update if it continues. The speaker is in the back of the phone and is quite tinny sounding. Blu had to save money somewhere on this phone and I suppose this is where they chose to do so. The screen is top notch and build quality is excellent.  People say I sound clear on calls and I can hear everyone just fine. This will depend on your phone carrier also. The phone takes two sims and you can set it up to use data for one sim and voice for another. You can also store apps on your micro SD card IF the app allows it. Some apps will not. If you don't want to spend a lot for a phone but want plenty of value for your money this phone is worth a try.

Update for 12/19/2015  There have been no more issues with any of the keyboards I use lagging now that all apps have been set up. I restarted the phone last evening after the last app I wanted to install was put on and have been using the phone quite a bit since then and I have not had a repeat of the problem so far. I do find the default keyboard not to be that great looking but I understand it is quite popular in some circles. This phone is slow to charge up to full. It took over two hours and twenty minutes from about 36% down yesterday but with intense use it has held up nicely so far today. The screen is quite bright so turning it down if not in direct sunlight will also help the battery life. Because the phone is new I am using it more than usual so it will a few more days before I know what battery life will be for me. I still think this is the phone to get whether Blu ever updates it to Marshmallow or not. This is a lot of phone  for a small price. I did not turn on encryption because it can slow down some phones. I will let someone else try that out and see how it works for them.","5.0 out of 5 stars"

--Screen is amazing.
--Beveled edges on the Gorilla Glass make my finger tips very happy.
--8 core processor is super snappy. Performs better than my Galaxy S5. Antutu benchmarks over 37,000. Mediatek challenges Snapdragon with great performers like this.

--Camera is snappy and has so far taken excellent quality pics.
--MicroSD expandable storage
--Build quality is excellent, looks flagship quality.
--GSM unlocked, works excellent on my T-Mobile. Also has T-Mobile LTE band 12 for better indoor data coverage.
--Near stock Android without all the bogus annoying software you get when you buy a Samsung or any phone from the carrier.

The phone performs very well. My wife uses it as a daily driver. The battery life is great and last the whole day without needing a recharge. I did have to use SMS Pro to get the MMS working on Cricket. The screen is very crisp and I used the Adaptive brightness setting to make the phone last even longer on the battery. The phone responds very well when installing applications as well as using applications. The camera works very well as well. The only downside about the phone is that it takes longer than my Moto G 3rd gen to charge. The included accessories such as the flip case work very well. The screen protector is very small and does not fit the screen completely. I recommend purchasing another set of screen protectors. I hope my phone lasts at least one year. If it lasts one year my investment will be worth it. I also hope that this phone gets the marshmallow update.","5.0 out of 5 stars"

It was so good that I'm giving him free advertising. In case you don't want to check it out, I will sum it up for you and add a bit I learned from other sites (Android Authority, and a few others):

Build:
Excellent feel in hand, and has a premium metal band around it, and a removable leathery plastic back (much like the Note 4's).

Screen:
Great looking budget screen, on par with either the iPhone 6 plus or 6s plus screen, just 0.3"" smaller and not quite as bright.

Performance:
Great snappy all roud performance, better than this year's Moto G by double on geekbench (Single Core was around 600, while Multicore was around 3000). RAM management was excellent for 2GB RAM.

Battery:
Above average, it got somewhere around 8:30hrs on a video playback test (This year's Moto G got 7hrs for comparison).

Camera
A better camera than you would expect for the price. Both cameras (front and back) are exactly on par with this year's Moto G.

Speaker
Tiny and underwhelming volume. The phone's weakest point.

Other Notes
It has all necessary bands to work well on T-Mobile, but is missing Band 5 for AT&T (Google Band 5 for more info).
It is a dual sim device.
Micro sd card support for up to 64gb extra space.
Battery is 2900mah and non removable.
No fingerprint sensor is included.
Dimensions 149.5 x 73.6 x 8.6 mm (5.89 x 2.90 x 0.34 in).
Weight 141 g (4.97 oz).
It only has bluetooth 4.0, so you will not have the latest there.
No NFC.
FM radio is inluded.
Built in GPS.
Processor info:
Chipset - Mediatek MT6753
CPU  - Octa-core 1.3 GHz Cortex-A53
GPU - Mali-T720

Well that's all the information I could gather up, hope you found this helpful in deciding whether to purchase this phone or not.","5.0 out of 5 stars"

I bought 2 when Amazon took 50$ off the item. I've been using them since they arrived and the phone is absolutely wonderfull for the price.

The camera is really good, I mean, for the 99.99$ price is amazing (still for the 150$ price), better than the camera of my LG G2 and that phone was 520$ when I bought it. I can compare this phone with the LG G2 (which I think is an amazing, fast and good quality phone) I think this one is even faster.

The Blu Life One X is really fast, it kinda amazed me, I wasn't expecting this phone to be that fast. The photos taken with flash look really nice too, the same for the front flash and camera.

About the battery, I charge the phone every 2 days, one charge can last up to  2 days of normal use (browsing, whatsapp, Facebook, Instagram, emails, calls, taking photos, recording videos and stuff like that). It last more time than my LG G2

The screen looks wonderfull, the colors, brightness, everything is really good!. The screen sensitivity is just about right, perfect. I also own an Alcatel Pixi 3 (4.5) and it's awfull, you almost need to ""punch"" the screen to do something.

The adroind system looks almost the same as the Acaltel Pixi 3 so i'm used to it, I find it really cool.

So, great phone

I don't know if there are better phones for the real price (150$) But I can totally recommend this one.","5.0 out of 5 stars"

Generally I like the phones and what you are supposed to get for the money it would be good value for the money. The phones do have a good look and feel to them but there seems to be slight differences in feel from the black to the white. What I didn't realise was the battery was NOT removable but everything was in the box as advertised and arrived on time.

Pros:
1. The front facing camera with a flash is a great addition. Picture quality is reasonable
2. The usual dual sim that Blu has come to be known for. This model carries two (2) micro sim slots
3.The phone is GSM, unlocked and can be used with any carrier

Concerns:
1. The phone charges slowly. (takes over 8 hours to get a full charge) what makes it worst, the phone discharges quickly. WITH NO USAGE AT ALL the phone will discharge at least by 20%-30% in 2 hours. When compared to my previous Blu Life Play X this is poor battery life which carried the same apps and more than this Life One X 2016.

2. The phone does not come with the traditional silicone case which in some regards is good since it gives the phone a different look, however to put on the case you have to take off the back that the phone comes with to clip on the case. The challenge with the case is that it is not comfortable to text with and the phone only seems to be better manipulated with your right handed. I am not sure if the intention was for the user to fold the case back but I can see over time the case will begin to tear and unfortunately I have not seen any other cases for this phone. In addition, the case forms the back of the phone and offers no real protection to the sides or edges if the phone drops

3. The screen protector that the phone comes with does not cover the entire face of the phone.

4. I set the phone off time but it does not shut off even when the time has passed

Having the knowledge I do now, I would have made a different choice especially because of the battery performance.","3.0 out of 5 stars"

I had the phone for a day and is working better than I expected. It updated to fix most of the issues that some buyers were complaining about like battery life and ringtones. My only problem is how light it is, so I'm waiting for the case I ordered . The FF flash makes so much sense and should be standard on all phones . Set up was easy.  I just put in my straight talk SIM and SD card from my Blu studio 5.0s2 and everything works fine for me. The screen is magical. To anyone  looking for a phone that won't break  the bank I highly recommend this phone.

Update
This phone is amazing. Finally got my case for the phone and it fits like a glove(wood grain plastic case for wiko fever).  I been watching reviews of the Honor 5x and Blu vivo 5. So glad I didn't get one of those because I don't like the UI look, yes I know a launcher can help with that but The One X is close to stock Android . Did I mention the front facing camera w flash. The best $150 I ever spent .

Update 5/17/2016
Damn Blu the battery on this phone sucks. The only reason I got this phone was the ff flash and storage. Yes I read the reviews about the battery and it was true . Don't get me wrong I like the phone but charging is a b'#@h . I should have just waited and paid $50 More for the vivo 5 but I didn't want to wait and didn't like the os skin .

Overall: I've been using Motos and Samsungs for several years and, this BLU Life One X gives them a run for their money.  I use my smart phone all the time, and from what I can see so far, this one can be a game changer.  I'm not a gamer and not constantly watching videos, but I do push the phone with odd applications, etc.  It seems to be able to handle these.  Excellent quality at a very good price.  16GB onboard, 2GB RAM.  OctoCore processor.  Nothing cheap about this.

Build Quality: Excellent - feels solid.
Phone - Excellent - strong signal, good sound.
SMS/MMS - Excellent.
Display - large, excellent resolution Gorilla Glass.  Very responsive.
Video - Excellent quality, no lag or chop.
Camera - Excellent - Clear & simple to use.  Flash too!
Bluetooth  - Excellent connection and sound quality.
OS - Basic Android 5.1; no lag, works just like you would hope.  No bloatware.  Just ready to go. There was an update, but done in 5 minutes.

General Observations:
- The box it came in and amenities - charger, cable & earbuds all very nicely and solidly packaged.  Feels high quality.
- The optional, but included case is a flip open ""checkbook"" style.  This leaves a little to be desired. The case is one where you remove the back and clip the optional one in.  It has a flip cover with a cutout to see the screen.  I'll be replacing this when more options are available, but for the time-being it works.
- I charged this up from 65% - took about an hour.  Logged on to wifi and transferred my apps and settings via Google backup and all worked very smoothly - no problems at all.
- Popped in my Cricket SIM card in SIM slot one, and it worked - no mus no fuss.  No settings needed changed or complicated gyrations.

Again, just a few hours in using it, this BLU is a winner.","4.0 out of 5 stars"

There's a few places that had to compromise and it mostly is with the unoptimized buggy Blu software, but you will not find a phone for this price that's better.  The camera isn't anything to write home about, they claim it has phase detection autofocus that's fast but it's painfully slow and most of my pictures are blurry even when I'm still so I hope they get this working better with a future update.  The phone launched with some initial issues like custom ringtones not working, the touchscreen would be unresponsive at times and the wifi would have intermittent issues.  But Blu released a bug fixing OTA update on 1/26/16 and it seems to have fixed only the issues with the custom ringtone that I can see because I still have wifi problems mainly when trying to stream pandora over wifi.  To set your own ringtone you go into sound, hit the 3 dots, add profile, name it whatever you want, then choose your ringtone and this will now work after the latest update. The update hasn't seemed to have fixed the wifi issues or the touchscreen being unresponsive at times.  But It's good to see that Blu is listening to the customers complaints about issues and getting them fixed seeing as this is probably one of their hottest phones right now.  Overall I recommend this phone for the money, if money isn't an issue then you wouldn't be looking at this and would be getting something like a galaxy S or Nexus phone.","3.0 out of 5 stars"

The phone was quite snappy and had some good things going for it, but ultimately its negatives weighed it down so much that I thought it would be troublesome to own. The biggest con for me was the slow charging time. The first charge from 30% to about 99% took around 6 hours and then a few days after first beginning to use it, it would either not charge up, its battery level would drop even while charging (with screen off), or its battery level would hover while charging (with screen off). I cleared the cache numerous times, as I heard that might fix the charging issues, but it didn’t. Even if the phone would charged properly, the charging time was still far too long for me to deal with. I remember times with previous phones when I needed to quickly charge from 10-30% before going out or traveling somewhere. It hasn’t been an issue with any of my previous 6 Android phones.  Here are the pros and cons of the phone:

Pros:
- Beautiful display
- Fast, snappy Android experience (I used Nova Launcher)
- Nice build
- 2 sim card slots and 1 micro SD card slot
- Long battery life when Power Saving mode was enabled
Cons:
- Slowest charging I’ve seen on any phone going back to my first in 1999
- Tinny sounding speaker which is on the underside of the phone (not ideal for podcasts or speakerphone)
- Camera has trouble focusing and requires multiple attempts to finally focus. In some cases it wasn’t able to focus
-  Limited selection of cases/covers

I looked at the Asus Zenfone 2 Laser, Alcatel Onetouch Idol 3, Huawei Honor 5x, and Motorola Moto G (3rd gen). I ultimately went with the Moto G because despite its 720p screen, it is splash/water proof, it has a decent camera, it has close to stock Android, lately Motorola has been OK about pushing out updates for at least 1-2 years after each phone release, and it has Gorilla Glass.","2.0 out of 5 stars"

Cons:
Battery life is a drag. Drains very quickly. Takes time to charge.
Another issue I have is with the software. Phone automatically connect to any open wifi such as xfinity etc. and disconnects from the LTE. Its a good feature until you realize that not all open WiFi are free and you have to either subscribe or login. Problem is if your were using the data it does not work anymore because you are not connected to the internet. Very annoying in actual usage.

Cover that comes with the phone is nice, but it will get time to use because I keep pressing the power button for it to unlock and it actually locks it back since unlocking and locking is being monitored by the proximity sensor.

Games:
Scrabble is not an issue on this one. Previous model couldn't even handle that.
Asphalt 8 not so much. There is a you tube video comparing this phone with moto g where they show that this phone handles Asphalt 8 easily. I cant confirm that in my usage it was painfully slow to load, extremely frustrating to  play due to choppiness.

Final Verdict:
My previous phone was Lumia 920. If I wouldn't have broken the screen third time and unable to find a really good replacement screen, there was no reason to upgrade to this phone. Its actually a downgrade based on the features and performance alone, except the screen size and added benefits of more expanded range of apps on android. Anyhow, I will keep the phone. Its a nice phone for daily usage if you are not a gamer. For them this is not the phone. Overall I am happy with my purchase...until now.","3.0 out of 5 stars"

As budget smartphone's go, the features and usability of this device impress me thoroughly.  While a flagship killer, it is not, it is the perfect alternative to the $700-$800 commitments currently offered by the major carriers.  I use this phone on StraightTalk with the AT&T SIM and have enjoyed great service and exceptional call clarity.  The phone feels good in hand and performs at or above the level of the Galaxy S4 (which is currently $300 unlocked) that I had previously.  If I had to nitpick, I'd  say the phone could charge faster and the speaker isn't the best, but I have enough Bluetooth speakers that it doesn't really matter.  Overall this phone has ended my reliance on high priced carriers and payment plans and for that I will be eternally grateful.

I had great difficulty getting MMS (picture messages) to work properly with this phone.  BLU support responded with this information:
""...set APN Type as the defalt,mms,wap for AT&T (and AT&T based carriers) or default,mms,supl for T-Mobile (and T-Mobile based carriers).  In addition, for Cricket Wireless, I had to use AT&T's MMS servers:
[...]

MANY places online advised different settings than the ones that I have found to work, and Cricket Wireless online support was not able to assist, claiming that the device was not working as it should.

Please see the rest of my original review.

Original review:

The BLU Life One X (2016) is a fine phone and well-priced.  I have owned mine for a week.

Things I Iike:
1) Size.  The phone's size is excellent.  You almost have to hold the phone yourself to appreciate how thin it is, which definitely helps when you are putting a phone with a 5.2"" screen into your pocket.  And I can put it into my front pants pocket, even when wearing jeans.  This phone is a little large for one-handed operation.
2) Display.  Again, the size is good, the colors, brightness, viewing angles, resolution, all very good.
3) Price.  I bought at the $99 introductory price, but this is still a very good budget phone at the regular price (currently $149 as I write this review).
4) Android has been largely left alone.
5) Performance.  It is very zippy. I run tons of apps and this phone has taken it all without a hiccup so far.  With 16GB on-board storage and 2GB of RAM, lots of space to load your apps and lots of memory to run them.  8-core processor.
6) Takes good pictures
7) It's unlocked.  So now that even ATT has indicated that they are phasing out traditional 24-month wireless service contracts, there is more incentive than ever to go out on your own and get the most phone for your dollar so that you can shop around for the best prepaid wireless plan.  With a phone like this, you are free to move to the better plan whenever it comes up, as long as it is on a GSM network.

Things I don't like:
1) The power button is on the middle of the right side of the phone.  I sometimes bump it while just trying to hold the phone.  Annoying.
2) With the new BLU Vivo series phones announced for this month, you can actually get a lot more phone in the Vivo for just a few more dollars if you get one of the Vivo phones at the introductory price.
3) The included folio case/cover seems to be the only cover you are going to find for this phone as of right now. That is important because of #4
4) The gorilla glass covers the entire front of the phone and is installed in such a manner that if you drop it, I think there is a good chance that the screen is taking the hit.  There is no bevel or anything on the edge.  The screen is not in-set at all.
5) Battery is not removable.  So I am not sure what to do if the phone ever locks up on me.  Every Android phone that I have had has required that at one point or another, I remove the battery as the last resort when the device is in a hung state.
6) It will automatically adjust screen brightness for you based on input from its light sensor, but there seems to be a delay associated with it, like perhaps it is only adjusting it once every minute or something.  That is not really that bothersome, but worth mentioning.

Other thoughts:
I was not really in the market for a phone at the time that I saw this one at the introductory price, but a friend had a good experience with BLU phones and when I saw the features for the price, it seemed a no-brainer to give it a shot.  This is easily the best phone I have ever owned, and at $99 it is also the cheapest.  BLU has raised the bar on entry level Android phones.  This does not look like or feel like a budget phone. It is beautiful.  It would be nice if someone would manufacturer a decent protective case for this unit...my only real gripe with the phone is the position of the power button feels awkward to me.  If not for that, I would have given a 5-star review.

Update February 2016:  You can purchase a case for it now (and I did).  I bought this one:  http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01AVT8XZS?psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o03_s00
It is not an awesome case or anything, but there is nothing wrong with it, either, and it does resolve the issue of accidentally bumping the power button.

I hope you found this review to be helpful.","4.0 out of 5 stars"

Exceeded my expectations, especially for the price. I needed to upgrade from my Samsung S4 which was beginning to act erratically. Plus I really don't like all the Samsung bloatware they added at the last update. Does anyone anywhere on the planet use S Health or any of the other crap you can't delete? I was really interested in Moto G and Pure Play and the new Nexus range because I really like the pure Android experience. But I don't need a huge phone, and my need wasn't urgent. Then I saw a couple reviews of this guy, and especially since I grabbed it for $99 I figured even if it was a dog I would be too unhappy. But far from a dog, it's a really nice phone. About the same width as the S4 but a little taller. Gorilla glass has a fantastic feel. Plus dual SIMs and LTE.  I am hoping for the 6.0 update sooner rather than later, but Android 5.1 is running smoothly and oh yeah, did I mention fantastic battery life? No? Well I should, because it does. Great phone all around.

UPDATE:  Forgot to mention great audio quality on a phone call. It seems like most reviewers these days are more interested in talking about the camera or the ""feel"" of the back; but first and foremost the darn thing is a PHONE and you want to make PHONE CALLS! I have wondered whether the bad audio quality I had with my Samsung Galaxy S4 was due to the phone or the network. Now I know, it's the phone. had a long long call yesterday and audio was crystal clear.","5.0 out of 5 stars"

I just had to compare this for myself. I'm a faithful Samsung Android user and currently have a S5. I've got to say that I was completely impressed with what I recieved in the box. This phone was solid, easy to configure and fast. I set this up using my T mobile sim from my S5. I didn't have any issue and in about 10 minutes I was up and running. While the interface was a little different, most everything was the same. I've used the phone now for about three weeks and its performed flawlessly. Great video, great wireless, great pictures, great voice, great app support. I have had no issue to complain of. This phone does not have the finger scanner, NFC or IR that the Samsung had but I didn't find myself missing those items. In many ways, the standard Google OS accommodated forIfthose functions in other ways. All my apps functioned normally and I was very pleased.

All in all, I would definitely recommend this phone to anyone. This phone even makes my consider not purchasing 700.00 phone in the future. If ididn't still owe 350.00 on my S5 (that's only worth about 150.00 on the retail right now) , I would keep using this Life One X.

This company has definitely proven that you don't need to spend a fortune to get 90% of the features you use every day. The other 10% of the advanced features may be nice to have but are they really worth the extra 500.00?  It really makes you think. For an unlocked phone, this thing is a steel. I highly recommend.","5.0 out of 5 stars"

The reason for this is after having sent back my first Life One X due to a faulty proximity sensor not blacking out the screen during calls (resulting in numerous instances of muting people, putting them on hold, deafening myself by accidentally turning on the speakerphone or just hanging up on them- all with my cheek or jaw) my replacement is charging (slowly) upstairs after having discharged its battery in the space of hours, even while plugged in. This is after the battery patch Blu released and with minimal usage.

I factory reset the phone and am hoping the issue will sort itself out. Meanwhile the $30 Risio is chugging right along with over half battery after a day of moderate usage.

With all the specs this phone has on paper I was hoping that any bugs (even big-name phones have them) would be minimal. I love the features, I love the crispness of the display. I love the fact that Blu was able to keep bloatware to a minimum. The camera, while shaky, takes crisp pictures and does a decent job. These aren't enough to make up for the glaring problems of unusually quick battery drain and proximity sensor problems that render the unit all but unusable for basic functions (you know, talking to someone and having a battery that will last you through the day).

I want to love this phone. If I were to rate it solely on paper qualifications it would be excellent. As it is its on probation- if this current round of attempted fixes don't work I'm returning it also and going with the Studio Energy 2 I was originally looking at.

UPDATE:
Went with the Studio Energy 2. It only took 2 months (5 1/2 weeks of which was spent waiting for the first One X) for me to go with the BLU phone I originally was looking at. Like my original review said I wanted to like the One X but the more I dealt with it the more it seemed like a rushed, bug-prone device. Loving my Energy 2.","1.0 out of 5 stars"

Top pros: the 5.2"" screen... It's great, a little warm but HD is evident and the contrast is best I've ever had with an IPs display. Battery life is wonderful with its 2900mAh battery. Slim form factor is nice, fits in pants easily and is extremely light which I prefer, but that's more my preference after 2 years with an htc one m7. And beat stock feel is great with added features that are welcome and useful like double tap to turn on the screen(though it does like to do this in your pocket at times so I've setup a pattern unlock). Oh and microSD expansion which so many manufacturers are mistakenly moving away from.

Ok so the quick cons: audio is not a strong suit, though that's not very surprising... But even audio out of the 3.5mm jack has interference/cracking(not sure if that's just my phone though).  Slight lag issues; this is not a power house phone with only 2gbs of ram and a plus middling processor, but again for the price this is probabaly more than most would expect.  Baked in apps aren't the greatest either like the phone dialer or just the stock UI, but luckily for Android this is easily remedied. And as other reviewers have noted, the screen has a tendency to turn on while you're talking on the phone and I've muted a few calls on accident which was incredibly annoying BUT now that I know about it I'm more careful(you can pull your face away for a second or two, place it back and the proximity sensor starts working properly again).

In total, wow....for all this phone lacks: nfc,quick charging, better audio, fingerprint scanner, lack of solid phone accessories(cases primarily) this phone still doesn't disappoint. Love that I can take this baby overseas and pop a SIM(or 2!)into this global/unlocked phone.  Another pro is that you can freely move around to other cell service providers(but unfortunately in the US this is harder to take advantage of) and take some decent pictures with it too boot.

If you're not looking to break the bank with your next smartphone purchase and your ok with not having all the ""latest & greatest"" features then this is the phone for you. Especially if you're like me and use your phone mostly for Web surfing and some YouTube-ing. Good phones are getting cheap and this is definitely a good phone.","4.0 out of 5 stars"

This is strictly a How To Guide on how to root this phone and how to install Viper4Android on it.

I am creating this guide for people like me who have been searching for a while for an exact, concise way to root the BLU Life One X (2016) which is available on Amazon. I have had to piece together information from various sources as well as helpful people on XDA such as manos78, yrude and rogersa2k.

DISCLAIMER: FOLLOW THESE INSTRUCTIONS AT YOUR OWN RISK. I WILL NOT BE HELD RESPONSIBLE FOR BRICKED OR UNRESPONSIVE DEVICES!

Model Number: BLU Life One X
Build Number: ALPS.L1.MP3.V2.21_6753.65U.G_P11
Custom Build Version: BLU_L0070UU_V12_GENERIC 09-11-2015 18:44

This phone is similar in build to the Wiko Fever and Micromax Canvas 5 E481 so a modded Wiko Recovery is used in Fastboot to help establish root. But first the bootloader must be unlocked.

On your PC, you need to have ADB Fastboot files in order to use these commands so I'd recommend downloading Minimal ADB Fastboot. You can get that from here: http: //www.mediafire.com/download/dl43w72ko84gyb3/minimal_adb_fastboot_v1.3.1_setup. exe

Install Minimal ADB Fastboot on your computer, preferably on your desktop so it's easily accessible.

Next download the CWM recovery file from here (you can also use TWRP, but for this particular instance I chose CWM so that's what I'll provide a link to. I don't like giving instructions for things I didn't actually do myself.):
http: //www.mediafire.com/download/0tueoydk6ka80p8/recovery_mod_wiko_fever_beta3. zip

Unzip the file and place the recovery-custom-wiko-fever.img in the Minimal ADB Fastboot folder you placed on your desktop. Now hold the SHIFT key + right-click inside this folder and choose the option “Open command window here.” A CMD window should appear. Leave this open and set it aside for now.

We first need to unlock the bootloader and since the unlock process will delete all of the files on your phone, it's recommended to perform this before you even login and download apps and settings, etc.

Once gaining access to your BLU Life One X, go to Settings > About device and touch Build number seven times to enable Developer options within the Settings. Back out of this area and go into the Developer options that you just enabled and turn On USB debugging and OEM unlocking.

Now plug your device into your computer via the USB cable and wait for the device to show up under Computer by pressing the Windows + E keys. Open the device in this window and leave it at the screen where it initially shows all of the phone's folders.

Download SuperSU from here: http: //www.mediafire.com/download/gsgawcjvll6l871/BETA-SuperSU-v2.52. zip

Place this zip file into your phone's folder that you opened up previously.

Power Off your device but keep it plugged into your computer.

UNLOCK THE BOOTLOADER

Power On the device into the bootloader by simultaneously holding the Volume Up + Power buttons until you see the BLU splash screen, then let them both go.

In the CMD window on your computer, type: fastboot oem unlock and press the ENTER key.

On your phone, select YES with the Volume button to scroll and the Power button to execute it. Then select the option to reboot the phone. This erases all of the info on your device like a Factory Restore. Two reboots are automatically performed and the bootloader will be unlocked.

If you want to check and see if the bootloader is actually unlocked with the CMD window, enter: fastboot getvar all.

INSTALL CUSTOM RECOVERY

Now you need to flash the custom recovery you downloaded earlier. Ensure that you still have your device hooked to your computer via USB cable and make sure the CMD window to that folder is open.

Reboot your phone into bootloader mode by simultaneously holding the Volume Up + Power buttons until you see the BLU splash screen and then let them both go. Use the Volume Down button to select “bootloader” in the menu and press Volume Up to select it.

Within your CMD window, type: fastboot flash recovery recovery-custom-wiko-fever.img
(After you type recovery a second time, you can press the TAB key and it will fill in the rest of the filename.) Now press ENTER.

After the recovery has been successfully installed, unplug the USB cable from your phone.

Hold the Volume Up + Power buttons simultaneously until the phone shuts off then let go of both buttons. Wait a second and hold both of the buttons again until you see the BLU splash screen, then let go of both buttons. This will now boot into the custom CWM Recovery you installed.

ROOT

With the Volume keys, scroll to the option that says “Install zip” and press the Power button to select it. Scroll down and select the file BETA-SuperSU-v2.52.zip that we placed on the phone earlier. Press the Power button. Return to the previous screen by navigating with the Volume buttons and then select “Reboot Phone”. Make sure you select the option that says “Yes - Fix root (/system/xbin/su)” and press the Power button.

You are now rooted! To check, install Root Checker from the Play Store or some other app that requires root and make sure you press “Grant” when the option pops up from the SuperSU app.

VIPER4ANDROID

Now it's time to install Viper4Android on your BLU Life One X! Download it from here: http: //www.mediafire.com/download/dvg222yc22hcp77/ViPER4Android_FX_v2340. zip

Also you need to install SELinux, which you can download from here: http: //www.mediafire.com/download/n78rplbcnk6867x/SELinux. apk

On your phone, go to Settings > Security and make sure you enable Unknown sources so you can install the following programs.

Unzip the Viper4Android file and place only the ViPER4Android_FX_A4.x.apk file on your phone via USB as explained before. This is the older version that worked with KitKat and unfortunately it's the only version that will work with this phone. Install it on your device but don't open it, yet.

Next, install SELinux on your phone and open it. Select “Permissive”. This is very important or else Viper4Android will not work!

Next, open Viper4Android and install the drivers (I always choose Super Audio Quality as it gives you more audio options). Next you must reboot your phone normally.

Congratulations! You now have Viper4Android installed!

ENJOY!","5.0 out of 5 stars"

I needed the SD card slot to store my music on, the Moto X only had 16GB internal which left about 3GB for music. Now I have a 64GB card in the Blu.  Screen on the Blu is awesome.  I like the solid aluminum frame, feels premium.  The textured back is grippy.  Performance is about the same as the Moto X.  Feels smooth on most apps.  Only had a tiny lag on Facebook Lite, but not on the regular Facebook app.  I do miss the special features the Moto X had with the voice commands and screen notifications.  Call quality is good.  Speaker is kind of weak.  I like the clean Android 5.1 BLU uses.  Almost stock Android and no bloatware other than a few apps.  Being unlocked means no AT&T bloatware.

Reccomended!

2016-01-27 Update:  Using and SD card causes a bug where you cannot use any custom ringtones.  Hopefully BLU will fix this. Not a deal breaker but is annoying.

2016-01-28 Update:  BLU has pushed out a bug fix update. If you use a custom audio profile, you can now use custom ringtones and notification sounds.

The screen is really nice and the leather cover/case that it comes with is actually pretty sturdy (especially for me since I'm left handed and I have to fold it all the way back). Also, the case stays pretty compact agains the phone, so it doesn't increase the bulk at all. It receives 4G LTE on T-Mobile really well here in Salt Lake City, but it has also worked in other cities I've been in since owning the phone. The battery is able to last a whole day, and I'm a moderate to heavy user of it. It's a really nice design and seems to have a sturdy build quality to it. The camera is ok, nothing to write home about. The call quality is average for me. Some people have been saying that the speaker on the back isn't loud enough, however it seems loud enough for me, but it is a bit tinny at times. The only downsides I've found is that the screen seems to get out of calibration very, very easily where it would take a swipe as a tap or vice versa and that it takes FOREVER to charge (so I try to time it where I charge it overnight instead). Overall, I would recommend this phone to anyone who is looking for a budget smartphone.","4.0 out of 5 stars"

======================== ORIGINAL REVIEW FOLLOWS =======================

I've been using the phone for a few weeks and am very pleased.  I'm coming from a Moto G 1st gen and this outperforms it as well as my wife's Moto G 3rd gen.  I won't repeat what has already been posted numerous times, but I will address some bits of misinformation in previous reviews:

1.  I've read the phone frequently drops wifi and switches to mobile data.  I have not experienced this whatsoever.  My wifi connections have been rock solid even on weaker router signals.

2.  There are no touch-dead spots on my screen.  Entire surface is functional and as sensitive as any phone I've used.

3.  The SMS/MMS does work with Cricket wireless.  Use the following APN settings (no root needed):
Name: ATT Phone
APN: phone
Proxy: Not set
Port: Not set
User name: Not set
Password : Not set
Server: Not set
MMSC:[...]
MMS proxy: proxy.mobile.att.net
MMS Port: 80
MCC: 310
MNC: 150
Authentication type: None
APN type: default,mms,supl
APN protocol: IPv4
Enable/disable APN: APN enabled
Bearer: Unspecified

4.  The speaker isn't going to blow your ear drums out, but is loud enough for me to hear the ringer in a crowded room and to wake me up in the morning.

5.  Google Voice/Hangouts works just fine contrary to a previous review I read.

6.  Custom ring tones can be used but they must be set in the built in system settings.  Apps such as Llama can change system volumes but can't change the ringtone itself.  The ringtones can be on the SD card, as well.  UPDATE (January 31):  V14 OTA update apparently fixes this if you were previously having issues (I was not).  Settings -> Sound & Notification -> General -> Gear Icon (next to General) -> Phone Ringtone.

7.  You can choose to install the apps in the on board storage or on the SD card.  You do not have to install them to the SD card and can change it in settings.

8.  I've had no issues not auto-connecting to stored wifi connections.  It has worked just fine and has never connected to a router which I didn't previously have saved.

9.  Asphalt 8 and other graphically intensive games do work and the frame refresh rate is high enough to make them playable.  However, they aren't as smooth as a $500 phone or my iPad.

10.  I've had no problems with the built in alarm waking me exactly on time.  I have had issues with 3rd party, alarm/timer apps waking the phone.

11.  Yes, the phone is 16G, but only has 9.46 free due to the OS.  This is typical with any phone.

12.  There is about a 1/2 second delay from pushing the power button and the screen coming on.  It was slightly annoying at first, but now I don't even notice it.

13.  Battery life is good enough to get me through an entire day.  Battery recharging time is below average.  However, I've never woken up to a phone that wasn't 100% charged if I left it plugged in overnight regardless of how low it was.  After 2h 27m of screen on time and 11 hours since I last had it plugged in, my battery is at 59%.  UPDATE (January 31):  V14 OTA update seems to have fixed some of the battery issues.  My battery appears to charge faster.

Some things I haven't checked but hope someone might verify or prove false:

14.  Can't watch movies stored on the SD card.

15.  Can't connect to hidden networks.  UPDATE (January 31):  This has been verified as incorrect.  Super Max commented that he has no problem connecting to hidden networks.

Hope this helps.  If you are encountering any of the issues addressed above, you may have a faulty phone.","2.0 out of 5 stars"

I ordered the phone on the $99 special, it took five weeks to arrive.

Although several reviews say LTE can be used on both sim cards, only one sim can be used on 3G/4G/LTE at a time.  The choice of bands is only enabled for whichever sim is selected for data (which can be either sim).  The other sim only gets 2G, which is a bit limiting (especially in Canada).  This is normal for dual sim phones, but is perhaps unclear from those reviews.

The cell broadcasts option for emergency and amber alerts (usually under ""wireless and networks / more"") is missing (or well hidden somewhere else). Wi-fi signal strength (only the 2.4GHz band) is slightly below average (in other words, not as good as my other phones).  Cell reception is average, nothing special.

Main camera focus is slow and doesn't focus very close, so reading barcodes (for example) is harder than some other phones.  Really the autofocus is quite poor for indoor shots, not good enough for photographing documents. (yes, this is after the plastic cover has been removed from the lens).

Still, for the price, it's usable, but not great.","4.0 out of 5 stars"

- Cheap USB charger: makes a high pitched whining noise; I wouldn't trust this charging overnight; get a different charger
- Cheap headphones, screen protector is not form fitting (made for different device, does not cover screen entirely)
- GPU could be better (gaming performance is not really great)

My quirks with the phone are minor overall. I still think this phone is a steal for $150 considering the competition.","4.0 out of 5 stars"

I have been very happy with the quality of the external speaker. The 5.1 Lollipop system is lightning fast.

On the one hand, it is a fully legitimate smart phone.  My last several smart phones have been HTC flagships.  This is my first phone I've purchased outright, and it holds its own against a flagships from a year or two ago.

The reason I can't recommend it is that within about a week of use, I notice one morning that the glass surrounding the rear camera was completely shattered.  I don't know when or how it happened.  I've had 4 or 5 smart phones before it, I treated it the same, and I've never had a lens or screen break before.

Blu support says I need to agree to $50 charge to fix it, and if they find anything else that needs fixing after I send it in, they'll charge more than that.  Replacement parts aren't available for me to replace it myself.  I don't know what 5P lens is supposed to mean, as they advertise, but I'm not impressed.

I'll list the Cons and Pros in order of importance to me.

Cons:
1) Lens either self destructs or is incredibly fragile
2) Touch screen takes more pressure to register than other smart phones I'm used to.  When playing Words With Friends, occasionally I have to press 2 or 3 times to register.
3) 3 button Android headset buttons control volume rather than track advance.  Apps don't seem to be able to correct that.
4) The edges of the screen are beveled, so tempered glass screen protectors won't fit

Pros:
1)Very usable as a daily smart phone, doesn't feel like a compromise in function
2)Has MicroSD
3)has band 12 LTE for T-Mobile
4) price
5) 1080P
6) Lightweight, reasonably thin, good size and proportions
7) Looks pretty straightforward to disassemble and repair (once parts are available)","2.0 out of 5 stars"

I'm an Android user and Lollipop 5.1.1 runs really well. The phone is very vivid in color and I actually have the screen brightness down to like 20-25% because the brightness is so strong (but that's a good thing). It is pretty clear to view outside if you increase the screen brightness to about 50% or higher. I'm a medium use phone user and I can get 2 days without charging it. My best piece of advice though is to keep the phone on ""power saving"" mode though (available in the drop down menu), as I noticed a significant decrease in battery life with this turned off.
I am on a T-Mobile plan and the call quality, wifi and 4G LTE all work great. If you have any questions, please feel free to ask.

Fast. The octa-core processor more than does it's job. Very fast with no lag.
The only app I've had crashing issues with is Chrome, and that's primarily because I usually have 20-30 tabs open at once while simultaneously playing music. Even then it's only crashed twice.

Great battery life. This phone will EASILY last you through the day with moderate use.

Beautiful 1080p display. At this price point you couldn't possibly ask for more. Might be the best thing about this phone.

Cons:

It takes this phone an ETERNITY to charge. 4 hours AT LEAST. Somewhat made up for by the fact that the battery life is so long. Still, this isn't the kind of phone you can charge for 30 minutes, or even an hour and have over 50% battery.

The touchscreen itself is pretty iffy. It's fine when doing things like texting but it has a pretty noticeable problem with scrolling. Whether you're scrolling through Instagram comments or a webpage, the screen will often stick and click links your finger went over as you're scrolling. All phones will do this every once in a while, but this phone does it A LOT, to the point that it's very annoying. I switched to this phone from the LG G2 and the difference is easily noticed. If this were a higher priced phone this might have actually been a deal breaker.

Overall I think this is a very good phone, easily worth the price. It has issues, but no phone at this pricepoint will be perfect.","4.0 out of 5 stars"

I am on t mobile network, works fine. Synched up fast with my google accounts and apps loaded quickly. I was easily able to remove the preinstalled apps (not many to begin with) and set it up in under 15 min. Upgraded from an LG L90 so this feels like a night and day difference. The cameras are great and the screen is very bright and responsive. I was not worried about purchasing a BLU phone after reading and watching countless reviews from people on here and Youtube. I am so glad that I upgraded, I would not spend more than 200$ on a smartphone in the first place ever. This phone feels and looks like phones 3 times it's price so I feel like I really got a deal. I am keeping the folding case on the phone that comes with it because i could be devastated to ruin this lovely phone.

This does not feel like a cheap phone also, as many people online have also mentioned. The aluminum sides and plastic/rubber back feel great in your hands and give it that expensive feel. I really don't mind that the charging port is on the left side of the phone and not the center, that is one small thing people complained about but I don't see the big deal.

Bottom line: This phone is simple but does not feel like a 150$ phone, if you are iffy about getting this phone and you currently have something that is older/slower/and keep telling yourself to ""wait it out"" just do yourself a favor and upgrade to this awesome device.","5.0 out of 5 stars"

It's missing a gyroscope, which means it can't sense a wrist flick.  It's also missing a finger print scanner, NFC, and quad HD.  OK... but it's also $150 and frankly for me, those functions do not matter to me.  For the people it's made for, (basic smartphone functions like web browsing and apps) it's fantastic.  The battery lasts me more than a whole day of heavy usage, at least 3 hours of on screen time.  It plays all the fancy games I want to because it has an 8 core + graphic intense GPU that I could want.  Plus it's thin and light.  So if you're looking for EVERY FUNCTIONALITY that a flagship smart phone has, this phone won't meet your needs.  However, if you're a heavy smartphone user who doesn't need the missing features, well this phone is perfect for you.","5.0 out of 5 stars"

I didn't have high expectations, seeing as how it only cost me $150, but the specs seemed good enough, so I gave it a shot.

I have to admit, I was pretty blown away. The screen is large and clear and the resolution is perfect. Bigger than the Moto G, but not as ridiculously large as the iPhone 6+ (which doesn't even fit in my hand properly). I don't consider myself overly techy but I guess I am, as I had about 60 apps on my SD card that transferred. Most of my apps and contacts from my SIM card transferred, only a few on each card didn't make it properly. That was a huge plus, to basically just plug and play.

I don't hardcore game, but on the couple games I do play, I never have lag. I have also never had lag on texting, typing of any kind, or any of the apps I use. It's refreshing to go to a phone with 2GB memory and not have to constantly close apps in order to make another one run properly.

Camera is good, honestly, it seems on par for all of the other phones out there. None of the selfie cameras are any good, no matter what brand you buy. I'm a professional portrait photographer, so naturally, my phone pictures SUCK.

Package came with charger, screen protectors, second back that doubles as a case, and earbuds. Pleasantly surprised! This phone is definitely good quality and I haven't found a fault with it yet. I've had it for about 2 weeks. :)","5.0 out of 5 stars"

It served well, but I needed/wanted an updated phone. After some looking, this Life One X fit the budget and the specs I hoped to have. I have to admit, this phone is better than I expected! Especially for the price (which really isn't part of my joy).

Let's start by saying this phone is fast. Runs any app I have, and then some, without batting a digital eye. Netflix, Spotify, games, productivity .. you name it, a champ.

The camera is really good too. Before, I had a 5MP camera. Which was decent for what I used it for. HOWEVER< the Life One X's 13MP rear camera is sharp like a tack. Great pictures, not waiting for it to work. It just .. click, done. Click done. Fast. And the 'selfy camera' is a 5MP which is a good surprise. I can take a shameless selfie, do some periscope videos, whatever I want - done. I can do skype calling with my family several states away .. all simple and fast and lookin' good. I'm endlessly impressed!

The one thing that I've yet to get used to is the sensitivity of the touch screen. While not a ""con"" per-say, it is a bit frustrating how many people I accidentally call when scrolling through my contacts. This is more me needing to get used to the sensitivity.

I bought two: One for myself and one for my wife (who's never used a smart phone before). We're both pretty well pleased!","5.0 out of 5 stars"

Background

I don't like spending a lot of money on a phone, I was using a Lumia 640 but decided to jump back to Android.

The BLU Life One X was impressive, it's very thin and the ""leather"" like back helps the grip, much more than my super-slippery Lumia 640.

The screen is fantastic, very sharp with excellent colors, way better than the Lumia 640. The higher quality photos look almost 3D because they're so sharp.

I have zero complaints about the screen, I'm not sure how any phone could have one better. Also, the screen can be made very bright, brighter than any other cell phone I've ever used.

The Life One X is fast enough, no problems for me, although I'm not a gamer.

It's nearly pure Android 5.1, definitely a plus. A couple of apps added and actually the Blu launcher isn't bad, but I installed the Google launcher.

It's very thin, it weighs 142 grams, it's also a dual SIM phone, I never needed that feature but it's there.

The touchscreen seemed sensitive but there's a setting for low, med and high and I changed it to medium and it seems better.

The phone is also very easy to hold in one hand, although I'm not a good one-hander anyway with phones. It does seem kind of tall and narrow though, not quite 16:9 when you hold it horizontal.

The speaker is in the back and the volume can't be made loud enough for me and conversations are very muffled, which is the biggest disappointment. But people on the other end say it sounds fine.

Battery life is very good, I uninstalled as many apps as I can and I use the mobile website versions, it makes a big difference.

I also uninstalled the home screen wallpaper and am just using pure black on the home screen. I miss not having the announcements that display on the blank screen on the Lumia 640 when it's in sleep mode.

The phone received an update from BLU the second time I turned it on. The only thing I notice is that sometimes if I go to move an icon, the phone won't take a long press, it immediately opens the icon. But if I open some other app, then close it and go back to the home screen, the long press then allows me to move the icon. Not sure what's up with that, I'll keep an eye on it.

I couldn't get the Android ""Smart Lock"" system to work correctly. This is where you can set it to not require a password when you're at home or a specific location. But it is inconsistent; sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't.

I bought a phone blocking app to block spam nuisance calls; that feature is part of the Windows phone system and it works really well, you don't need an app, it's built in. Also, Google's new Messenger texting app is nowhere near as good as the built-in texting app in the Windows phone. Oh well...

I would have kept it but after a couple of weeks, I just can not live with the sound quality on the BLU Life One X. I like to use the phone on speaker and the speaker on this one sounds so muffled that I have a really hard time understanding what the other person is saying. That's ridiculous, considering the tiny 2 mm single hole on my Lumia 640 had much better and clearer sound.

There's a much wider horizontal opening on the back of the Life One X so the speaker should be much better. BLU needs to work on that and then they'd have pretty much perfection.

I've tried it with and without the sound clarifying feature on and off and it's maybe a tiny bit better with it off. This is really the most disappointing aspect of this phone.

I mean, how hard is it nowadays to include a half-way decent speaker so you can hear a phone conversation? I have to get everyone to repeat about every other sentence, it's really bad.

I didn't want to spend the money, but ordered a Motorola Moto X Pure Edition instead from Amazon, very sorry the BLU phone didn't work out for me because I like everything about it but the sound.","2.0 out of 5 stars"

It isn't without its flaws but overall for the money it's an amazing phone especially with the help of a few third party apps.

Now the long story... I'll start with the good this screen is beautiful performance over all is pretty good. Lte service here in Philadelphia has been fantastic and I haven't had many complaints about call quality just some light cracking that was more likely the fact I was in a busy street. Battery life is pretty good but will very much depend on  how much you use this pretty screen. Even then I've been averaging about 12-15 hours of moderate use with about 4 to 5 hours of screen on time. I'll also note without quick charging if you use the phone while it's plugged in it barely charges at all. If you leave it alone however it take about 3 hours to completely juice up which isn't too impressive either considering it comes with a 1amp charger.  I did switch to nova launcher for a bit more customization of the home screen. There can be some lag especially when first opening apps especially things like my heavily skinned gosms app. But overall the phone is snappy and an improvement over my 2013 moto x it replaced. The cameras are also a great surprise in a phone on this price range. It's not gunna replace your Dslr or even a top tier phone but for 150 bucks it's damn good especially in the professional mode you can really get some beautiful pictures. Also the smart gestures when the phone is locked to quickly launch the camera and flashlight are absolutely genius and work flawlessly except the. Music one which Now brings us to the bad my first complaint is a double edged one cuz on one hand I credit Blu for including a screen protector and case for the phone in the box. Buttttt...  The screen protector doesnt actually fit and while the included leather case is a nice touch the software that it uses lacks any customization and even in my case it often completely bypassed my phones lock screen.  It does have music controls in the small window but they only work on the stock music player. And while it gives you a small icon for a notification it also brings a pointless screen that rather than reading the notification info just tells you to open  the phone to view. And it doesn't even open to the notification if it's clicked on or opened when on that screen. It just goes to the home screen. It just seems like it was a poorly programmed after throught. Take the leather case off however and you find a pretty vanilla android experience and it was a very easy transition from my moto x. It may just be me or my device but I find the screen to ether be way to sensitive or completely dead.  For example scrolling through a Web page I often accidentally click icons but when using SwiftKey I often have to press the delete key multiple times before it registers. (this may also be due to the skinomi screen protector I applied after finding the included one didn't fit but it that gives the screen a grippy feel I'm not a fan of yet) I also mentioned the music player before that it links with the leather case app but when you don't have the leather case on the music player bar in your notification wimdow just won't go away you have to go into the setting and force quit the app. So like all of the other android  phones I've used over the years I've resorted to power amp which works great. Also for those who want that nifty notification light to actually light up for notification download blink from the app store. Just note the led only displays red and green. And the systems battery led notifications will take precedent over the notifications from blink. Outside of that there is little to complain about in this price range it certainly beats at&t prepaid phones in the price bracket.

My final thoughts I have yet to find a serious problem with this phone other than some of the software should be updated to give you more preferences. A marshmallow update was supposed to come out early this year but as of now I'm still on 5.1 so I'm very interested to see if Blu finally comes through on a phone update. There is certainly a lot of potential and I think with a good marshmallow update battery life could improve greatly I just hope they take some time to fix the leather sheath app cuz it does give the phone a nice feel.","4.0 out of 5 stars"

After almost a month of use I pulled the phone out of my pocket and noticed a crack across the screen. I thought this was weird, as the phone had been in my possession since I unboxed it. It had never been dropped, or had any any kind of impact whatsoever. A little research revealed that this can happen if the screen is not installed properly or the glass has any internal flaws. When this happens your screen normally won't shatter, instead it gets a hairline crack that usually runs from one edge of the screen to the other. That's exactly what happened to my phone, as you can clearly see in the picture.

So now I got a cracked screen on my phone but I thought ""no big deal, it still works"" and moved on. Then a week later it appeared to download an upgrade and rebooted, and immediately got stuck in a boot loop. The phone would boot until it reached a screen that said ""Android is starting.... optimizing app *** of ***. "" It would hang there for a minute and then reboot.... and repeat this until the battery died.

So now I have a cracked screen AND a non-working phone. Still, I though ""no biggie, this phone is clearly defective and BLU has a one year warranty. I'm sure they'll stand behind their product and just replace / repair my phone, right?""

WRONG!!!!!!!! I emailed their support team, and got a reply with a phone number. When I called them I spoke to Anthony, a CSR with BLU, who informed me that my warranty was void because the phone was physically damaged. I informed of everything I've said here, and referenced the same picture I've included in this review. he informed that they basically only warranteed software problems (his words, not mine). I replied that is the same thing as not having a warranty, since any defective piece of hardware could be considered physical damage. He apologized, but still refused to consider replacing my phone.

Long story short, this phone worked like a champ for a month, then the screen cracked spontaneously (I believe it was defective) and a week later the phone bricked during an OTA upgrade. BLU refused to replace it.

Maybe this is an isolated case, and BLU makes a great product. However, don't expect them to stand behind it. At all.

BTW. Amazon is awesome. Their customer service department, after learning of my troubles with BLU, refunded my purchase price. I will not be purchasing another BLU phone.","2.0 out of 5 stars"

I had issues with my Cricket Wireless MMS (photo - video messages) and called them.  They were very helpful.  They have earned a loyal customer in me!

For those of you with Cricket Wireless, you will want to know this:  I thought there was a problem with my phone because I could not send or receive picture messages.  I changed my APN settings several times, using various settings I found on here and the internet and none of them would work.  Then I found out that you cannot have WIFI enabled when sending or receiving MMS.  You have to use the connection to Cricket's network (their data).

AGAIN, something everyone with Cricket Wireless will want to know:  MMS will not work for sending or recieving MMS messages if you have WIFI enabled.  WIFI must be turned off to send or receive MMS messages.  If you have WIFI enabled when an MMS message comes in (a photo for example), you will have to disable WIFI in order to download it.

The APN settings for Cricket Wireless are -  Name: Internet -APN: ndo - Proxy: Not Set - Port: Not Set - Username: Not Set - Password: Not Set -Server: Not Set -MMSC: [...]- MMS Port: 80 - MCC: 310 - MNC: 150 - Authentication type: Not Set - APN type: default,mms,supl

Pros(as of posting): Easy to root,
snappy and responsive,
the touch panel is great,
colors are what you'd expect from an IPS(I can't vouch that's the same for people who aren't red-green colorblind),
great stock ROM,
useful false leather case(optional, comes with a standard backplate),
dual SIM(for those who actually need it),
supports micro-SD card,
Corning Gorilla Glass III,
speakers are loud and clear,
the cameras are a huge improvement from my old mobile device, and so far I have no complaints,
and probably many more that I have not mentioned here!

Cons:
Not very simple to unroot once rooted,
short battery life(so far), compared to my NeuTab G7 phablet,
battery is not removable,
stock OTA update has some issues from what I've noticed(you can update to the latest version from Blu as of posting this),
and probably some more that I have not mentioned here.

For $149.99 this device is entirely worth buying.
If you are wanting something for work and home use-seperation(using the dual-SIM slots) then this device would be ideal.
If you are just needing a phone for basic to semi-advanced needs, then this would probably be a great option(as far as my needs for a mobile device go).
If you are someone who wants to play games, I wouldn't know if this is a great option as I've never tested games on it.
If you are someone who streams videos for long periods of time(1 hour or more) this will probably not be a very good option as the battery drains quite fast when watching YouTube from my testing.
This device works well with Ting as a provider, although I'm not sure if that is relevant.

I would highly recommend this device if what I roughly described above is your average daily use/demand for a mobile device.

Happy shopping!

Regards,
Cole","5.0 out of 5 stars"

I had high hopes for the BLU Life One X after reading & watching positive reviews from PC Magazine, CNET, Android Authority, Android Police, Android Headlines, Android Guys, Phone Arena, Phone Dog etc. While waiting a month for the phone to arrive; I watched & read every review available. My high expectations were instantly deflated, when I tried to perform the simple task of making a hands free call using my Plantronics Voyager Legend Bluetooth headset to make a call. I pressed the call button on the Bluetooth headset and the voice dialer would not activate on the phone. I made sure that the Google voice setting for using the service with a Bluetooth headset was activated. I went through all the setting to no avail. I gave up and called BLU tech support. I rudely got hung up on, after being told the BLU Life ONE X doesn't support voice dialing with a headset. The following day, I placed another call to Blu tech support for further clarification. This tech support person told me that the BLU LIFE ONE X only supports Bluetooth 2.0 not 4.0. This is false advertising, since all the promo material and reviews state the phone supports Bluetooth 4.0.  Furthermore, I also called Plantronics tech support for confirmation. During the call, I  encountered a more professional customer service rep. He went over all the proper phone settings with me and verified that they were all correct. He determined the problem was with the phone not the headset. I've used the same headset with an LG L70 & Samsung Galaxy Avant and never had any issues. In addition, when just using the handset to make calls, the screen intermittently turns on. I had read previous comments about this on Amazon & confirmed it. It seems the proximity sensor is defective or malfunctions.
This is the first time I stray from buying a brand name phone. I will never make the same mistake again. I am disgusted with all the Android media outlets & Youtubers who sold out by giving positive reviews for a free phone. I find it hard to believe that people who make a living reviewing Android phones, off all price points, didn't notice these basic flaws. Instead of offering consumers a service they performed a disservice. If I could save at least on person from the trouble & disappointment I went through, it will be worth it. At least I only paid $99 for this sorry excuse of a phone. However, I will be returning it for a refund, since I can't comfortably using it for its primary purpose as a phone. All the other bells & whistles (screen resolution, RAM, ROM etc.) are secondary.
In Summary:
Don't believe the Hype!!
Pros:
Can't tell you because the phone didn't fulfill the basic purpose of using the phone hands free with a headset & screen turns on when using the handset.
Cons:
1) False Advertising: Although all the promo material states the BLU LIFE ONE X supports Bluetooth 4.0, according to their tech support currently (1/14/2016) all their phones only support Bluetooth 2.0.
2) Phone doesn't work with Bluetooth headsets.
3) Phone screen turns on while using handset causing you to accidentally press numbers/ characters during a call.
4) Menu settings and options are very limited in comparison to other brand manufacturers. For example, the call setting menu.
6) Battery drains oddly. Within first few minutes of use your down to 90% battery left. Battery standby seems decent.","1.0 out of 5 stars"

After a couple of full charge cycles, the battery is also working well and easily last me through a day (and up to three days) of use. The screen is sharp and crisp and the build quality is solid.

My only complaint is that I can not get individualized ringtones to work. Although I can set them under contacts, the default ringtone is what comes up for every number.

I DO NOT recommend this phone to anyone.

Lastly, my overall experience with Amazon was also terrible. They charged almost $7 for shipping and still took over a week to arrive. As a reference, I bought a Dell computer last month online.

The screen quality is good, not as good as a galaxy or a nexus but still impressive for the price.
One vey nice feature is the flash of the frontal camera, for people who takes selfies at night, or with low light, is very convenient and useful. Also the camera app itself has a few very useful modes for taking the right picture at the right time.

Also, with Lollipop you can track, lock and erase your phone if it is stolen. AVG also has a new app that cannot be removed with a factory restore.","5.0 out of 5 stars"

It's taken some time to get it set up properly with email, etc.  Was able to transfer contacts from my old phone using an app from the store.  Converting from a Windows phone so there has been a learning curve to Android.  The phone's default setting was to save text messages to the SIM card rather than the phone. Don't know why but this caused me some grief before figuring out the problem.  Overall I feel good about the purchase. The price is right.  Display is excellent and Gorliia glass is nice. Battery seems to make it through the day just fine,  however I'm not a heavy user.  It's been difficult finding a protective cover.  I ordered one from Amazon when I ordered the phone but is was cancelled for some reason.  Ordered another that's supposed to be here March 10. I tried the flip cover provided for a while, but just didn't feel comfortable when texting,  etc. So far so good. Hopefully it will last for a few years.  A good alternative so far to other overpriced options.","4.0 out of 5 stars"

I checked on Amazon and discovered that there was a two week waiting period between ordering and delivery before I can actually get the phone. I bought the phone nonetheless and decided to wait since I had another phone that I could use though, it was not 100% functional.

I finally got the phone in January 2016 and it looked and felt great. I was glad that I had made the purchase. The construction felt sturdy and the metal body and slim design, plus its features just made the phone feel like a premium phone. Unfortunately though, less than a month after receiving it, it suddenly went dead. It was being charged and I had to put it down to take care of some other matters. When I returned to the phone, it was completely blank and dead. I tried turning it on and nothing.

I figured the battery was really drained, although I didn't know how or why, so I went to bed that night and plugged the phone in to charge hoping that by morning it would come back to life. I got up during the night and tried turning the phone on again and nothing. Tried again when it was day light and nothing. I then tried several other chargers other than the one that came with the phone to see perhaps if it was the charger that was at fault and still nothing.

At this point I was getting frustrated. I tried a local technicia who said it might be the battery, but that meant that I would have to source a brand new battery for a brand new phone. In addition, the phone has a tag that says if the battery is removed or tampered with, you void the warranty on the phone.

 I contacted Blu's customer service and they sent me a list of this that I should check or do and I followed them to the T.....and the phone was still unresponsive. I sent back a response to the Blu Customer Service, to the advice they gave and  all I received back was what I got when I contacted them in the first place asking for proof of purchase of the phone and some other things.

After all that, I decided to put the phone back into its box and leave it for a couple days. When I returned to it...there was a funny scent coming from the phone. I opened the back cover of the phone and upon examination saw what looked like spots of some liquid or substance and a strong odour, which I would assume is as a result of the battery being corrupted. I eventually got rid of the phone.

All in all this was a waste of money and I am very disappointed. This may not be the experience of everyone and I am not sure if this has happened to anyone else, but this was my first Blu product, and it is highly unlikely that I will be buying another one.","1.0 out of 5 stars"

- Cheap, nominally impressive specs for the price

I am using the phone with Ting, if anyone was wondering if they worked with that carrier. the speaker isn't as bad as some of the reviewers are making it out to be. It doesn't perform anything like the HTC one with Beats, but it is better than the HTC one s. The case that came with it is pretty slick. I haven't put the screen protector on yet either. Charging isn't nearly as bad as some made it out to be. I'm sure if you went from something that had rapid charge then it probably seems slow. I used the Wifi hotspot as soon as the phone was activated and it worked well. I used my wifi hotspot for my wife's phone until her phone was up and running with no issues. Very little bloatware. Very fast processor speed. For the money you really can't go wrong. Next time I need a new phone I won't hesitate to pick up another from BLU.

From the time I purchased this online until I got it was a bit slow, but the end result was worth the wait.

Over the first 3 days of owning this phone I have the following information. The first full day I had the phone I used 1.3 GB of mobile data, and the battery lasted 11 hours. The second full day I streamed music for about 4 hours, and my normal (I would consider heavy use) use. and the battery lasted from 5:45 am to 9:30 pm and had 33% remaining when I went to bed. Calls are clear, the mobile hotspot works great, I haven't had any lag issues with either gaming or any other usage. The flip cover is a nice addition. The stock android is wonderful.

After a little over a month in I still don't have any issues with the phone.","5.0 out of 5 stars"

I had my settings correct, display turned down, screen shut off after 15 seconds, etc. Two days ago it wouldn't charge past 40% after being on the charger for 12 hours. Unplugged and within 1 hour and zero use it was down to 20%. One hour later after using for about 5 minutes, it completely shut off. Plugged in phone for 4 hours and it wouldn't even turn on. Left it plugged in about 3 hours longer, finally got it to turn on and it had 4% battery life. I was able to do a factory reset, plugged the phone back in to charge. Two hours later, couldn't turn it on, it was dead again. It's draining every time it's plugged in and feels warm to the touch. My husband has the exact same phone and I've tried his charger with no changes. I'm obviously past my 30 day refund window for Amazon. I've just submitted a service request to BLU, so we shall see. I'm highly disappointed since we had BLU phones before this model that worked perfectly for over two years. We decided to upgrade to something newer and supposedly better. Now, I feel I'm out $150. Hopefully my husband's doesn't go out too, as we cannot afford to purchase phones again. I loved the phone in the beginning, I wish I could still love it.

The BLU Life One X is an astonishing work of art. Beautifully crafted from Corning 3 Gorilla Glass, supposedly aircraft aluminum, and a plastic back cover that looks and feels like leather. In the hand it feels every bit as premium as a smartphone that costs 4 or 5 times more. Aesthetically speaking, the device is outstanding. And spec wise, it is equally as appeasing. With a 1.3 GHZ Octa-core processor, 2 GB of RAM, 13 MP Main Camera, 5 MP front facing camera, along with a Flash for both, it's a wonder how they were able to pack all of this value into such a low cost device.  The phone itself also holds 16 GB's of storage, which can also be expanded using a Mini SD card up to 64 GB's. Even in the storage settings, you can set it up so that all your app data and the like can be stored on the Mini SD card.

This phone is snappy fast, has beautiful thin and light design, and high hardware spec for such a very low price.  It scored 37,209 on Antutu Benchmark v6.0.1, which is slightly faster than phones with Snapdragon 615 SoC.  I like this phone a lot and agree with most of the positive reviews people posted here.

The reason I gave it 3 stars instead of 5 is because I found that the time on the clock widgets I use most often (Digital Clock Xperia, Timely, and UCCW) does not update on this phone even though they work fine on all 12 of my other Android phones, all with Snapdragon SoCs.  Could this be due to incompatibility with this phone's Mediatek  MT6753 SoC?  Don't know, but this is the only Mediatek phone I have so maybe you readers can tell me if they work on your other Mediatek MT6753 devices.  What other incompatibilities does this phone have that I don't yet know about?  Thus the 3 stars.","3.0 out of 5 stars"

It had everything I wanted (and needed) in a cellphone.  Battery lasted very long time (for first 3 month), then I started noticing that it would only last for a day, then 3/4 of a day, then 1/2 a day.  Today I found it trying to optimize 172 apps in a continuous loop; it would turn off and on, try to optimize the apps again, turn off and on again. Sometimes it would just stay off until I powered it back up.  It did this for 12 hours before I gave up.  Phone is now USELESS.  I will say this, it's a great phone if you need one temporarily (ie going on vacation or need one overseas for a couple months) but for your day-to-day cellphone, its been a GREAT DISAPPOINTMENT.  I wish you knew HOW frustrated I am at the moment.  I wish I could get new phone from the company with the hope that this one was a lemon because I really loved this phone.  My fear now is that the same will happen in another month to the three other ones I bought for friends... I'll be so embarrassed it theirs does the same.

UPDATE: I just opened up the case, unscrewed those tiny screws and pulled out the internal battery.  The battery feels like a pack of gum in aluminum foil.  It pliable, not rigid. I'm not an expert on cellphones but every phone I ever owned used HARD, RIGID batteries and not a gummy bear type (perhaps other can comment on whether that is normal).","2.0 out of 5 stars"

The battery lasts longer than my Samsung S6 Edge Plus which kinda surprised me. But that's where the comparison ends. For a power user, this phone does lag and sometimes cannot catch up when multitasking. At times it even crashes and I have to reboot. Can't really compare a flagship phone to a budget one, but that's needless to say.

Otherwise, for general purpose use, this phone shines. I have never had a phone with a screen that never collected 'oil' from your fingertips. You can  wipe off the screen and no smudges or fingerprint streaks (for those who are OCD about these kinds of things like me). I don't know what coating they put on it but I wish they did this for every phone out there.

Bought the phone when it first came out so it was around $100 and to me, this has been the best BLU phone I have bought and used. It was money well spent. I usually donate smartphones to underprivileged teachers, but this one I am keeping for myself.

One wish... I wish BLU would make an X version 2 and put a really good camera in it and it would make this phone pretty close to awesome.

****UPDATE — MARCH 26, 2016

THE CHROME/SILVER POWER BUTTON FELL OUT and now I can't turn off the phone.

Minus 2 stars for quality and durability.

I will stick with my Samsung S6 Edge Plus. Only flagship phones for me from now on.

Another issue is that the phone doesn't support added users. It's blocked. Older and current version of Android would allow you to create added users.

-The battery takes forever to charge, one time it took almost 3 hours to get to 6% and that was with wifi and bluetooth turned off and very limited use (just a few texts here and there)
-The screen occasionally becomes unresponsive and i have to lock then unlock it for it to respond to touch
-There is an intermittent dead spot in the top left corner of the screen
-It wont send or receive photos via text even with good 4G LTE
-It occasionally sends repetitive texts, one time sent the same message 14 times
-least concerning is the fact that you cant set custom ringtones which is annoying
I think the one i got is a lemon, I've had the phone a week with these issues only because i wanted to see if i liked the phone enough to try a replacement or if i just wanted to send it back and find something else. I did request a replacement tonight and i'm hoping it will not have these issues as well, i will give an update when the new one gets here.
**update**
I've had the replacement for 3 days and it's wayyy better, I definitely received a lemon the first time. The battery is much better, in comparison to other smart phones it still charges pretty slow but it has lasted through the day with moderate use.
I'm still having issues with not being able to send or receive pics via text but after much research I've found its an issue between Blu and cricket wireless concerning the APN. I've tried changing the APN numerous times with no luck, they could not figure it out at the Cricket store either. To get technical for anyone considering this phone for cricket, the apn type does not have the option of ""fota"" or ""hipri"" which to my understanding is causing the issues. Apparently some have figured out how to fix it but I haven't been successful with any of their methods yet, will try for a little bit longer but if I can't get it to send or receive pics via text it's going back.
Overall I really like the phone it's a wonderful budget phone with amazing features, the front flash is great, not sure why all phones these days don't have one. Both cameras take really good pictures (once I realized there was a little clear plastic thing I needed to remove from rear camera lol)  There isn't much bloatware, I was a little disappointed in only a 16gig memory but that's not a big deal with a micro SD. I haven't noticed any lag even with 15++ things open.","3.0 out of 5 stars"

It play demanding games fine but I experienced constant lags and freezes. The UI just isn't fluid and compared to my previous phone, the htc desire 510, it is nowhere as responsive. Lag can be seen especially when I pull down the notification tray. It stutters and lags for at least 1 second whenever I pull it down. I am pretty sure it's software issue because this phone has better specs than my old 510. Blu needs to fix this issue

Battery leaves much more to be desired. Average screen on time I can pull off is 4 hours on medium setting. I am a heavy user and when screen is on, i usually play games like mortal x kombat and watch HD videos i downloaded or browsing chrome. Strangely, I never have slow charging speed many users complained. My phone is 90+ in just under 3 hours. Battery is about 60+ in 1.5 hours. When I plug it onto a battery bank, it charges even faster, no complaint there. Battery life is still too short tho. Furthermore, I occasionally experienced a wakelock bug wich drains battery when idle. When this happens, the wake bar on the battery statistics is one solid bar. I have to maunlly reboot to fix this.

Now lets talk about the software. Besides the occasional lag, wakelock, and unresponsiveness I already mentioned, the operating system has tons of issues. Uninstalling an app sometimes just hang. Sometimes, when i download apps from the play store, it's the same story, download just hangs and make little progress. I try to clear the data, guess what? The app hangs on computing the size. Battery wakelock also usually begins at this point so I believe these buggy install/uninstall are behind the wakelock issue.

Final note, buy the vivo xl. This phone is too buggy and battery is just medicore. 1080p screen doesnt compensate the shorter battery life and lower screen to body ratio.","3.0 out of 5 stars"

Battery life isn't great and charge time is slow but the touch screen is responsive and very crisp. The included keyboard seems to be overly sensitive and easy to overshoot letters and cause text havoc, but that's easily fixed by using a different keyboard app like swipe. I have not experienced any lag or stuttering in performance- Nothing seems to be messed up or wonky. For a $150 phone brand new, I think this is a keeper. It's no flagship-killer, but It performs quite well without breaking the budget. If I'm still pleased with it after a month or more worth of use, I'll buy my wife one. (Currently, this phone is WAY outperforming my wife's Lenovo Android)

Turning off auto updates to lesser used applications has helped battery life tremendously! If you're like me and would rather check your email, rather than constantly being badgered by notifications to do so, this won't bug you much!

I bought this phone to replace a perfectly good Windows Phone because I was tired of the Operating system's lack of support and compatibility with google. So far, the down sides of this phone have not overshadowed my decision to switch and I'm still quite happy with it regardless of the battery life. Camera is acceptable (I'm a photographer and when I want nice photos, I use my DSLR so a super high quality camera on my phone isn't a priority). I don't have a problem with the ""Tinny"" sound of the external speaker because I don't use it much. Audio quality on the handset and call clarity meets expectations easily.

but for me it works pretty well.  I have problems touching things that I should not when using two hands on a touch screen - this allows me  to
hold the case with one hand and touch the screen with the other.  This way I only touch things I shouldn't with one hand.  The window in the case is also nice as it shows time and notification icons when the case is closed.  Battery life is not as good as I had hoped - when phone is used heavily.

WhatsApp keeps hanging, I cleared cache, cleared data, unistalled, reinstalled and it's the same, whenever I open an image or a video in WhatsApp it will hang and after a while displays a message that says ""WhatsApp is not responding...""
A couple of times when the phone hits 15% battery it will just shut itself off, when I connect the charger it will show 0% battery.

Apart from these few annoyances and some other hiccups, the phone works nicely.
Maybe a software update will fix these issues I am having...

Update 04/12/2016*********

I am removing 2 starts ar I am still facing issues with this phone.
The phone keeps turning on in my pocket!
While I'm on a call the screen still turns on and my face interacts with the phone.
WhatsApp keeps crashing as soon as I open an image or a video and try to back out of it, it now kills any bluetooth connection that's active and the screen goes black.
It will have 15% charge and as soon as I turn the screen off and back on it drops to 1%.
The most amazing one! The power button Fell Off! I have no idea what happened but it was stuck and I could't get the screen on because of that so I gentle moved it with my fingernail and the button fell off! WTH?
Definetly my first and last BLU phone, that's for sure!","3.0 out of 5 stars"

I am especially interested in the emerging mid-market smartphones. I was excited to test this model. At $150, it offers real value. It's thin and light and has solid build quality, offers a bright 1080p full HD display, offers dual SIM support, has expandable memory, and runs near stock Android. The MediaTek processor is snappy and the battery lasts throughout the day. (I should say that I used the phone for calls, email, web surfing, reading books, and Netflix. I didn't try games.)

Even though the phone has some great features, it has some serious limitations. The battery is extremely slow to charge. I clocked it taking 3-4 minutes to change by 1 percent. The external speaker doesn't produce much volume. The camera isn't good indoors. Photos are dark, and the phone lacks image stabilization, so photos blur easily. But the biggest problem--and the reason I returned the phone--is the proximity sensor. It seems too sensitive, or perhaps not sensitive enough. During calls, I could see the screen flashing on and off in my peripheral vision. When the screen came on, my cheek would touch the speaker phone or mute button and interrupt the call. After a few days of this, I boxed up the phone and returned it.

This is a good-looking phone at a great price, but because it can't make calls reliably, I have to give it a poor rating. It's too bad. I really wanted to believe BLU had delivered a breakthrough phone.","2.0 out of 5 stars"

I bought the BLU Life One X (2016) to replace my AT&T Galaxy S4.  The S4 cost me $649 in May of 2013 when it was first released.  Since then it has been falling behind in performance as newer, faster devices were released at a rapid pace.  Now that I am on a cheaper plan with my provider I no longer get periodic ""free"" upgrades, so price is a huge factor in my device shopping now.  I must say I am very pleased with this device and thought I would provide some information to anyone else looking.

Look and Feel:
This is an area in which I think most budget phones are lacking.  I have handled some other low cost devices and they really do look and feel exactly like you would expect.  The Life One X however has a premium feel to it, has nice contoured edges and the touchscreen is beveled along the sides giving it a very refined look.  Plus it utilizes Gorilla Glass 3, which will help it to last longer with regular use.  This phone is beautifully designed, and is definitely not something anyone would hide in their pocket when people with their more expensive devices are around.

Screen size and resolution:
Another common place for budget phones to save money is on the screen.  Cheap phones typically have small touchscreen and low resolution.  Not this one, though.  The Life One X has a full 1080 x 1920 resolution on a 5.2"" screen with 424 ppi pixel density, which is about 25% better than the iPhone 6. The screen also has very rich display which is very customizable. It is definitely a bigger device than the Galaxy S4, but not heavier and fits well in my hand for one-handed use.

Performance and operation:
This is another area that BLU has nailed.  Even though it has a slower 1.3 GHz clock speed, that comes on an 8-core processor.  This is great with multitasking and this device handily outperforms the higher clock speed 4-core processors in benchmark tests like Antutu.  The 1.3 GHz processor is also easier on the battery, and I noticed even during heavy usage the phone did not get hot.  The Android ROM that runs on this phone is very nice.  It is very close to stock Android 5.1 Lollipop, with very few changes built into it. If you like Android, you will like this interface.  As an Android power user, I was a little disheartened that it is not easily rooted, but this is not a deal-breaker for the vast majority of users.

Battery Life:
It comes with a 2900 mAh battery, with is more than sufficient for regular use.  After a couple days of use, I get about 6 hours of screen-on time before the battery dies.  If you have the screen on for more than 6 hours a day, you'll probably need a bigger battery or plug it in more frequently.  That being said, I consider myself a fairly heavy user and I don't come even close to 6 hours of screen time on a daily basis.

Overall:
I must say I am very impressed and pleased with this device.  You would have to look into phones that cost at least twice as much before you find one that is clearly better.  For $150, you cannot find a better phone, period. Honestly I don't know how BLU is making any money on this device, given the quality that has been put into this.  This may not be a flagship killer, but for anyone on a budget the BLU Life One X is clearly the phone to get.

Updated to add:
I would recommend wiping the cache partition from the stock recovery menu. A few days after getting the phone I had trouble with it no longer turning off Wifi and not going into sleep mode. This would drain the battery very quickly.  After the cache wipe, which it goes to sleep almost immediately after powering off the screen and the battery life is amazing. I have only had to do this once, but if you notice in your battery stats that the phone is constantly awake or that Wifi is staying on even when disabled, then it would be time to do it again.  I am pretty sure this is a common problem with Android Lollipop.

Also, use the included charger.  It charges from almost dead to 100% within 2 hours.  Cheap aftermarket chargers or low amp chargers from other phones will take 4-6 hours to charge.","5.0 out of 5 stars"

I spent at least a week searching all brands on Amazon and reading review after review and this is what I went with. I like the Octa-Core processor as I think it makes things run pretty darn fast. The device feels light yet solid in your hands and the leather cover is a huge bonus. Be sure to buy expansion memory if you're going to carry around audiobooks or videos for offline viewing. Leave the phone memory for the apps. Great phone. All day battery life. I use a Plantronics Bluetooth headset. I would buy another one of these phones without hesitation.","5.0 out of 5 stars"

I am rating this based on the price because price makes where this fits.
I have Galaxy of all ages, Motorolas, LGs, and many others.
Take note, the only ALUMINUM on the body is the thin side strips, everything else is PLASTIC, yes, those top and bottom pieces are too, neither cheap nor high grade, but more toward economic feel. Fit and finish are as exactly how much you just paid for.
It feels exactly how $100 phones feel like, far from Galaxy S or A but Galaxy J K low ends, sure.
Aside from the body, it works as it should, additional to Octa Core, 2GB is fast, almost no legs.
I would recommend getting a 2A charger(Tablet Charger), or even bigger to charge quickly. 1A or lower will be extremely hot and slow.
The battery would easily last for a day,  or 15%/hr of drain when being used.

(Disclosure: I am not marked as a verified owner of this product, because I received this as a gift from a friend)

It boots very quickly. As soon as you see the lock screen, the phone is responsive. The SD card is mounted quickly too, allowing you to immediately use apps and files that are stored on the SD card. One thing in particular that I enjoyed about this compared to my previous phone, is that the entire internal storage space is all one partition, and references made to the ""sd card"" truly mean the external SD card you've installed to the phone - my previous phone had two partitions of internal storage, one of which was seen as the ""sd card"". Their small and identical sizes made it difficult to install larger apps, and this has been a non-issue on this device. In fact, this phone allows you to choose whether the internal storage or the SD card is the default install space for apps, so you don't need to muck about with rooting it or using developer options and a PC to configure that.

As a phone, it works great. Calls are audible and clear, and the other party can hear me just fine when using this. The external speaker (which is used for the speaker phone) is of particularly low quality. It feels too loud at low to moderate settings, and when you really need it to be louder, turning the volume up only seems to add distortion instead of actually making it louder. This isn't a huge problem for use in quiet or moderately noisy environments, but you will need to skip out on using the speakerphone for making phone calls and using headphones in noisier places if you actually wanna hear anything.

Both cameras are nice. The front facing 'selfie' cam is lower resolution, but in terms of picture fidelity, they come out pretty good. There are other reviews out there which show you pictures taken with both cameras, as well as this phones performance with a variety of games, so I wont go in-depth with those here.

The phone comes with a set of in-ear headphones. They are acceptable quality; their bass response is good, but it seems to come at the expense of the mid and high ranges. Mids sound flat and the highs are tinny. To be honest, a separate pair I own that only cost me a few bucks sound nicer than these. But the pack-ins do have a built-in microphone for phone calls and apps like skype, and has a button you can press which serves different functions (muting your mic in voip apps, skipping to the next song in music players, etc.). The convenience factor of the built-in mic and ease of use has me using the pack-in over some nicer sounding aftermarket headphones.

The screen protector is....okay. It's supposed to be sized to perfectly match the phone, but it's actually too small. It uses an adhesive backing to stick to the phone, which dust was immediately attracted to, my protector has dust trapped in it which has made the touch screen slightly less responsive, and at certain angles, the slight bubble caused by the dust reflects light and can be a little distracting.

They give you a 'case', too. It is made specifically for this phone and replaces the battery cover. It feels nice and doesn't make the phone feel too much bulkier than it already is, so it still slides nicely into my pocket. There's a magnet built into the front flap which holds the case closed when you're not using the phone, and the phone is set up to detect when the case is closed, too. You can still view the time/date and use music player controls when the case is folded shut, and it wont pocket dial on you in this mode, which is quite nice. One drawback to it; I prefer to hold my phone in landscape mode so I can type with both thumbs at the keyboard. Flipping the case back on itself to hold it like this doesn't seem to be intended, it creases it in a seemingly unnatural way, and the magnet wont hold the case shut for a few minutes afterwards. Maybe it just needs to be flexed back and forth? I dunno.

It's a great value for the money. I resisted upgrading to smart phones as long as I could, because for the longest time, there were only $600+ iPhones. Even with Android being on the market, phones were still priced at $300+ a pop, unless you purchased them used. It's nice to see that a company like BLU has recognized the gap in the market and is supplying a modern smartphone running a recent version of Android at this price range. There isn't anything a more expensive phone can do that I can't live without, and I am perfectly happy using it and recommending this to others.","5.0 out of 5 stars"

However, the camera was really bad at focusing and had a very slow shutter speed, which made out difficult to capture movement or anything in low light. Speakers were tinny and not great overall. After a couple of months, the power button fell off! I will be sending it to BLU for warranty repair, but shipping is at my expense and they will get it back in 15-20days! That's a little ridiculous, but not surprising given the cost of the phone.

The pros:
Has all the features I need for basic functionality
The user interface is almost pure Android (though not the latest version, but that's okay)
Call quality is good
Came with various accessories
Responsive and beautiful screen
Perfect size
Nice texture for gripping
The price!

The negatives are well known, it charges at a glacial pace and the speaker on the back isn't the best. I charge the phone while I sleep and don't use the speaker much so these aren't negatives for me. So long as the phone doesn't prematurely wear out, I'll remain happy.'

UPDATE: I've just knocked off a star. It is not safe for the phone to be kept in your back pocket. I put mine there, but closely monitored it out of fears it would bend. After a few days of sitting on it only, in soft seats like a car seat. It bent, not hugely and the phone still works but that is disappointing. Please treat this phone as a shirt pocket or maybe purse pocket if you carry one. I wonder if there is a case that can be put on that would make it safe for the back pocket, but I doubt it.","4.0 out of 5 stars"

I got the white one and it looks very similar to iphone. It has got a 5.2 inch screen with a octa core processor (one of the newest processors in premium phones). Also it comes with a screen protector and case as expected for the BLU phones. The case is not the usual one, it is very stylish folio case with window feature. You have to open the back cover and put the case on.
The phone comes with one of the latest version of android (5.1 Lollipop) with 4G LTE capability which is almost unexpected at this price range WOW!! As usual BLU provides dual sim slots and also expandable memory which is nice to have. The battery power is also higher (2900 mah) than the similar range phones. Moreover the phone has a nice set of gesture and motion capabilities which some of the premium phones also don't have, like double tap on the screen to wake up, write the letter m in sleep mode to directly go to music player or type the letter c to directly go to camera etc,etc.
The camera of the phone is also above standard and worth mentioning, it has 13 mp rear and 5 mp front camera with flash for selfie (this are camera specs of premium phones!!). I would say the phone is a pleasure to use and nothing to complain at this price range.

Now I am not sure if reducing one star makes sense but I wish I get some of these features:
Fingerprint reader which has become very common nowadays.
NFC
Super AMOLED screen
Step detector or step counter
Better speaker

Other than these above few expectation I am totally enjoying the phone.","4.0 out of 5 stars"

Now for the not so good...

I have, more times than I care to count, accidentally muted calls, activated other applications, switched input sources (Bluetooth/speaker/handset) because the screen failed to go dark and disable input while the phone was to my ear.

I had read in reviews when I was considering purchasing this phone.  I assumed it was a fluke or a user issue.  I have learned that it is not.  There are now more reviews indicating the problem and now mine has been added to them.

On top of this feature not working like other cell phones on the market, when I call Blu Support, the Support Rep indicated to me that this is how their phones are designed to work!!!  Unbelievable.  I tried several times to explain to the rep the issue and how is contrary to how every other cell phone works, she refused to budge, saying, ""That is how our phone is designed.  We don't have a setting to change that.""

I tried to get my call escalated, to talk to someone beyond Tier 1 support, but never got there.  I asked about their return policy and was told that it is 1 year for manufacturing or software defects.  I told her that I consider this a manufacturing or software defect.

Until they get this issue fixed, I would STRONGLY discourage ANYONE from buying this phone.

Beyond this one bug, I think it is a solid phone.","3.0 out of 5 stars"

My last two phones (Samsung Galaxy S4 and Alcatel Onetouch Idol 3) were dogs compared to this. I'm an avid hiker and when I hike, I like to track my trip (MapMyHike) and listen to music via bluetooth headphones and DSub. Of course I occasionally stop to take a picture too. The S4 and Idol 3 really struggled with this. Music would skip, taking a panorama would sometimes kill my apps (including losing my recorded GPS track). This phone handles these tasks without a single hiccup. Music streams perfectly and taking pictures while recording GPS and streaming music is no problem. This kinda makes sense based on the Geekbench multi-core scores. Single core among all 3 phones was similar but multi-core on this phone was twice as good, so this phone is good at multi-tasking.

The phone is also snappy AF. My last two phones would often slow down and just draaaaaag for no reason. This phone is quick and has almost no lag (so far). Navigation loads quickly and ""OK google"" works quickly. The camera is great, just as good as any phone I've used (it's probably not as good as the latest flag ship but it's also 25% of the cost).

The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because there's a couple minor quirks that hinder it. First, the battery drains extremely fast after I unplug it from the AC adapter after an overnight charge. I've found that if I reboot the phone after I unplug it, the battery life is GREAT (another user found that disabling the power saving from the notification drop-down, then immediately re-enabling it seems to have the same effect). I can easily go all day running multiple apps, GPS tracking, Bluetooth, music, etc. Just today I've recorded 2 hiking trips, streamed music, took pictures, surfed the web, and I still have 44% battery and it's almost bed time.

The other minor annoyance is that the proximity sensor doesn't work very well, and the screen will often turn on while I'm on the phone with the phone up to my ear. So far it hasn't been an issue for me but I've heard of other people accidentally hanging up the call because the screen was on and they unknowingly hit the end-call button. I usually use the phone via a Bluetooth headset so this isn't a big issue for me.

So, other that the couple small issues, I LOVE this phone, and plan on using it as my daily driver for some time.","4.0 out of 5 stars"

Better than some Samsung phone cameras. It does however have that softening effect but I can overlook that since this phone is only $149! The battery life is almost like an iPhone battery which means that you will probably have to charge this phone 2 times a day depending how much you use it. I saw myself charging it 2 times on the days that I used it a lot like browsing the internet basically all day and watching videos.

I did a lot of research pre-purchase since this would be my first ""post-Blackberry"" device after 9-years of straight Blackberry use.

First of all, the device looks and feels like a premium device.  The screen is AWESOME - bright and sharp. So far everyone i have shown it to cannot believe I only paid 150$ for it. It is not heavy at all, but also is not too lite as to feel cheap. Build quality seems very good.  It is also very slim and fits nicely in my hand.  I was afraid that the 5.2"" screen would be too big, but it is not.  This is however the maximum size i'd get since I like having my phone in my pants pocket.

Battery life is very good.  To those that are getting bad battery life, make sure you do the update and also disable the location setting. (GPS) I am not a heavy user and get close to 2 days of use on a single charge.  A heavy user can easily make it through the day.  Charging time is indeed on the slow side as some have pointed out, but if you are like me and charge it every night you will have no issues with this at all.

I have noted no lag or sluggishness. Performance is very good.  Android 5.1 is probably 90% stock. I also have a Nexus 7 tablet so felt quite at home with the Life One X environment.

The dual-SIM feature is really nice to have.  I am getting 4G LTE no problem at all. Since device storage is only 16gig, I suggest you also pick up a 32 or 64 gig MicroSD card with your Amazon order. There is a 3rd slot for a MicroSD card so it will not take up one of the 2 SIM slots as it does on some other devices.

Some people have said the speaker is bad.  OK ... its not fantastic, but for your morning alarm and hands-free conversations it does the job just fine. The sound is sort of ""tinny"".  If you want to listen to music with it, then you may be disappointed.  My advise: with the money you saved over an iPhone, pick up a nice Bluetooth speaker to pair with the Life One X.  I read a few times that people were not able to put their own custom ringtone. For some reason the process is not that straight forward, but I was able to put my own ringtone fairly easily.  What you need to do is put the file on the phone into the folder where your music is.  Then, when you go to the area where you select your ringtone, chose ""more ringtones"" near the top and chose to find it with the music app.  You will then see your mp3 ringtone and can select it.

In conclusion, I am very happy with my purchase and my research was spot on.  This phone is easily worth the 150$ price tag and I recommend it.","5.0 out of 5 stars"

The Blu wins on most all fronts. The ONLY thing I wish it had is NFC. That'd make it perfect. The phone feels very solid even though it is thin. Doesn't feel cheap even though it was. I bought two while the $99 deal was on. Very happy I did.
Best part is the screen. Really nice. Kills the Galaxy Grand Prime easily. The screens edge is slightly beveled which gives it a premium look. Colors are rich and blacks are good. My pics really pop, that's how nice the screen is.
The included case is cool. Fits as a back to the phone, not just a slip on case. Screen protector included is fine also.
I've used the phone as my daily and the battery has lasted me all day. It's 10:15pm and I'm at 35% still.
Call quality has been fine. I'm on T-Mobile and use band 12. No problems. Blu should get it certified for Volte and Wi-Fi calling thru T-Mobile. That would be another plus for this great device.

Great buy even at $149. You'll like it if your not looking for a 500 flagship. It's the best phone for the money in my opinion.","5.0 out of 5 stars"

-The system is fast, incredibly consistent, and very responsive, with decent standalone storage & solid, reliable connectivity across all ports.
-The camera is great, the screen is vibrant and clear, and casting/streaming/playback doesn't bog anything down.
-The interface is comfortable & simple, and similar to my Life 8.
-My only issue (just due to me being a total tone snob) is the audio. It's loud enough, but output is kind of muddy at any level; whether via speaker or connected to another audio source.

I was leery of the purchase as this is a new product and didn't have many reviews at the time. I was concerned while waiting for my phone to arrive as I read some negative reviews about battery (more on that later), wifi connectivitiy, bluetooth issues. I have not experienced any problems with wifi/bluetooth on my 3 phones. Note that I am using my phones on AT&T.
Pros:
-The screen is beautiful, though the curved glass might limit the number of cases and screen covers
-Build quality is great. All three of my phones have great fit and finish. Feels much more expensive. The flip case that comes with it is not my style so I am hoping for some third party cases. The phone feels great in the hand.
-Speed is great. I haven't noticed any lag. I don't game. Definitely faster than my Moto G
-Phone call quality is good. I haven't noticed any difference between it and my Moto G
-Mostly stock Android. You can delete whatever apps you don't want. Also, if you don't like the launcher, change it. Etc.
Some nice features that my G did not have-smart gestures and smart wake.

Cons:
-Yes, the phone does take a while to charge. But not a LOT longer than my Moto G. It might take 3.5 hours to charge fully. I tend to charge every night so it doesn't bother me.
-Rear speaker is definitely not as good as the front facing stereo speakers on my Moto G. But, it is function-able. Not being a gamer or movie watcher on my phone, this doesn't bother me much. And I rarely play music without hooking up to speakers.
-As noted by others, below 10% of battery and the battery does tick down every 30 seconds until it is dead. So, 10% of battery=5 minutes of life left. This was almost a dealbreaker for me but you shouldn't allow your phone to drop that low anyways so I'm not going to knock it too much for that.

Now, the big issue that almost made me return the phone yesterday: BATTERY. On the first day of use the battery was dropping like a rock. Even when the phone was not in use it was losing 5-10% per hour. According to the battery monitor ""Phone Idle Time"" was the main consumer of my battery's power. By a TON. So today I decided to download an app to check what was going on and it appeared as though ""Held Awake"" was consuming much of the power even though the phone was off. I shut off wifi, bluetooth, etc. trying to conserve. Then thought that perhaps Google was the culprit. I turned off Google Now Cards and recharged to 100%. 9 hours later I am still at 80%. I like Google Now Cards, but not enough to plug in my phone every 4 hours. Initially, I thought that Now Cards were ""waking"" my phone and draining the battery. However, after a few more days use it seems the battery is getting better. Perhaps the phone just needed to cycle through a few charges, but it is a powerhouse now. All day and still have 60+% later in the evening. Currently thrilled with the performance of this phone.","4.0 out of 5 stars"

I recently had a ZTE ZMAX (another budget phone) that cost me around the same price as this one. These are my thoughts on the phone:

Build and Size:
The phone is nice and feels very sleek. I purchased the white version and it looks beautiful. The back cover feels nice. I absolutely love the golden edges of the phone, it looks good with the white. This is actually a very thin phone and comparing it to an iphone 6s, it is almost as thin. However, it is bigger than an iphone 6s. I actually thought it was going to be too big for my small hands, but I think it is a perfect size. Overall, the phone does not feel or look cheap at all. I have gotten compliments on this phone and when I tell them the price, they are in shock. This phone looks like it costs more than it does.

Performance:
The performance is great.I have not experienced any lag on this phone. I have a 32gb sd card that is almost full installed on this phone and it has not made the phone lag. I have not tried any games on this phone, so I can’t say how well it performs in that area, but all other apps work great. I have a ton of apps installed and there is no lag at all. I have a Tmobile sim card in this phone and 4g works great. Calls, texts, MMS, and data usage is great on this. No problems at all in that area.

Screen:
The screen is my favorite part of this phone. Has a resolution of 1080 x 1920 pixels. It is crisp and clear. Watching videos on this phone is great and compared to my ZTE Zmax, which had a lower resolution (720 x 1280 pixels), the screen is beautiful to me. The colors are rich and vivid. The brightness on this phone is wow. Not sure if this would be a con for some people, but this phone is super bright on the highest brightness setting. On the lowest setting, it is still pretty bright. The screen also has good viewing angles. One thing though, like others have mentioned, the screen does not register you touch or swipes sometimes. That doesn’t bother me, but some might find it annoying.

Battery:
The battery is okay. Coming from a ZTE Zmax that had a battery of 3400mAh and used to last me almost a whole full day of use (heavy usage and lasted about 17 hours), the BLU life one X is somewhat a letdown (for me anyways). Yes I know the battery on this phone is 2900 mAh, but the most it had lasted me, with heavy usage from 100% to almost dying, was about 8 hours. Yeah that is pretty good for others, but for me, not really. I guess I just have to get used to it. However, sometimes when I am not even using it, the battery drops quickly. I always make sure to close all apps, clear cache, and what not. I feel like I am constantly charging this phone. My old phone only had to be charged every other day. I do the same things on this phone that I did on my old phone.

Call Quality:
The call quality is decent. I am able to hear the other person, not super clear, but it is fine. One thing though, off topic here, but when you are talking to someone and you have the phone pressed to your face, the screen turns on sometimes. This causes you to press random buttons with your face.

Speaker:
I honestly expected the speaker to be horrible, like some reviews have mentioned. It is not terrible, but it is not good either. It is not the loudest, but I think you can still hear things with no problem. I installed an app called Speaker Boost that makes the volume a lot louder. It really makes a difference, but the sounds sometimes sounds distorted if too loud.

Camera:
I have a love/hate relationship with the cameras on this phone. I have uploaded pictures for this review that show how the pictures it takes look like. Also, some comparisons between this and my ZTE ZMAX.
-What I love:
The 13 mp camera takes great pictures in the daylight. The front facing camera takes better pictures than my old phone (8mp camera). The LED flash makes front facing pictures look better. I adore that it has a front flash.
-What I hate:
The main camera does not focus. Apparently it has Phase Detection Autofocus, but not on my camera. If you get close to something and want to focus, it will not focus at all. Also, pictures come out blurry and multiple attempts at taking a picture have to be done. In low light, pictures aren’t that great. The front facing camera adds a soft effect, making pictures look bad. I have tried everything to fix that, but the only remedy is using the LED Flash to add more sharpness to the picture.

Comparing BLU’s camera to my ZTE ZMAX, there were times when the ZTE did a better job than the BLU. Now, both phones cost about the same. I am not sure if anyone else has problems with the camera, but maybe mine is defective? I guess I shouldn’t complain for $150, but it is sad that an 8mp camera is just as good as Blu’s 13mp.

Overall, I think this is a great phone for anyone on a budget. If you don’t care too much for the camera and if you aren’t a heavy user, then this is a great phone to get. It gets the job done and it is a beautiful phone. I will keep on using it and hopefully things get better with future updates (if they ever release updates). For the price, it is well worth it.","4.0 out of 5 stars"

First I'll start with the good. The screen is beautiful like many others have stated. It's crisp, it's clear, and viewing angles are good. Pictures and video look great so no problems there. I'm not a big gamer buy it seemed to handle them pretty well. Games like need for speed, the walking dead, and sim city played fine, although it did seem impossible to make purchases on sim city even on WiFi(you have to be quick in order to beat the other players to a purchase). Battery life held up all day and longer, but it would lose power rather quickly after unplugging every morning, easily dropping to the mid 90s after using the phone to scroll through headlines and emails. Expandable memory is there but I haven't used it, same as with the WiFi hotspot feature. The camera takes serviceable pics and videos, great in fact for a $150 device (purchased mine on sale for $100), but not Note 4 quality, but again you shouldn't expect that for the price you're paying. The front flash doesn't capture much unless you hold it fairly close so it has very specific and not a wide range of applications. And now to the not so good and bad parts. Swipe style typing is a pain on this phone. Tapping each button works much better but doesn't always work right either. I saw another reviewer complain about this same issue. The audio isn't very good either, placing a call on speaker is not going to do you much good unless the other person has a high pitch voice, if there's any bass in their voice it'll just be bad. But music sounds okay although not very loud. It's best used with Bluetooth or a headset. Now to the really bad... Talking on this phone with it to your ear is supremely frustrating. The screen comes on, you will be hitting buttons with your face, hanging up or adding calls, and changing settings all without you knowing. It happens ALL THE TIME. That is my biggest complaint, and it's a very valid one considering this is a phone and I want to talk to people with it. Charging is also very slow like others have stated, but I think that's the chip makers fault not Blu's. When the battery reaches 50% I immediately scale back my use so I know I'll have juice for later. Also I can't find a case for it yet, gotta have a case.

All in all it does do a much better job than my LG Leon that this phone was purchased to replace. Blows it out of the water so much that it was easier to compare it to the Note 4 than it was to the Leon. But sadly I wouldn't make this purchase again, maybe you will have better luck!","2.0 out of 5 stars"

1. it's very light, thin, beautiful screen.
2. responsive mostly
3. inexpensive
4. camera works fine for me.

Con:
These are the things that I find annoying.
1. I CANNOT customize ringtones with SD card inserted. What a basic function!
2. Customize ability. There're many functions that I wish but it doesn't have. Say Press Hold, in most phones you'll get a list of more functions, this phone doesn't really have these functions.
3. I can't change the order or group the apps. I can only do that when I drag it to the front page.
4. The ""Go Back"" button on the left top corner doesn't work most of the time.

I would say this is a great phone for older people care about how screen looks, and less about the functionalities.","3.0 out of 5 stars"

It has temporarily replaced my Nokia Lumia 920. The phone is great and I am tempted to get a BLU Windows phone.
For the price, I think you get a lot more than you expect. I have had no issues with the phone or the hardware, the only reason why I marked the product down one star is due to the voice quality when making a call. The call quality is really poor in comparison to the Lumia 920 and is possibly the only regret I have in buying this phone, I struggle to hear the person I am calling and they complain that they can barely hear me. Will I use it as a daily phone? With, what is for me, poor calling quality, that remains to be seen. Other than that, I am enjoying using the Life One X (2016)","4.0 out of 5 stars"

I ordered this December 16, 2015 when my S4 died. Finally got it January 11th. Almost a whole month! Now that I have the phone I'm pleased with the performance and the price is great for such a nice phone. It's a very tall phone which makes me feel like I'm going to drop it. It comes with a screen protector (sort of small for the large phone) and a flip cover (sort of ugly). I'm hoping new cases come out soon.
For now I can say it's a nice phone, I'd consider it a bit of an upgrade to my Galaxy S4

**3 month update:
Noticed a significant amount of lag when charging on my fast charging block. Switched back to a regular charger and now it works fine. :) Cannot stress enough how pleased I am with this phone. Highly recommend. When I'm ready for a new phone I will definitely be getting a BLU one!","4.0 out of 5 stars"

The phone has been the perfect antidote. For $160 it is amazing. It is well made and feels good in the hand. It is large enough and clear enough for all but the most demanding user. It also comes with the option of either a plain back or a back that includes a folding screen cover that not only protects the unit but puts it to sleep when you close it. It is has Android software that does take a while to get used to, and migrating your data from Apple to the new phone isn't seamless like Apple to Apple. If you are looking for a good looking and well made smart phone that does all the basic stuff extremely well, and your not afraid to make the transition to Android, I would wholeheartedly recommend this phone.","5.0 out of 5 stars"

Build quality is extremely good for this price. Looks like $400 phone. Build quality is no less than Galaxy Note 4. The case come with is also premium quality. But they cut some corner to keep the cost low. The stock wall charger comes with it is only 1A charger. I use a 2A charger with 1 feet usb cable to fix the charging time in case i need to charge fast. But slow charging is good for the Li Ion battery life. So no complain there. I do not play game. But for all apps I am using have no issue with the speed of this phone. I thinks they have made a perfect balance between cost and performance in this phone.

Another place they cut the cost is the speaker amplifier. Speaker volume is not that great. I use speaker a lot for watching sling TV, Netfix and other streaming on the phone. There is a software fix available for boosting the speaker volume. Download the app called ""Speaker Boost"" from play store and boost the volume by 20%. Make sure you set a clamp at 20% otherwise it will destroy your speaker. above 20% i notice that speaker started making noise.

Since they are using Media Tek chip set, I was worried about the modem performance on tmobile but it seems to be working much better than qualcomm 801 chipset. At home I used to have 2 bar and 4G only with qualcomm chip set. Now with this phone I am getting 3 bar and 4G LTE at home and speedtest.net app showing about 40 mbps download which is far beyond of my expectation. I used to get less than 10 mbps with qualcomm 801.

Both front and back camera are great in this phone. If you use the case you can still take the picture without opening the case by drawing C and use volume up or down key to take picture with the back camera. I like that very much to take quick shot. The video mode also have pause button that I appreciate very much and a must have option for me.

Couple of issue I still couldn't solve. I didn't find any repeat notification option in the phone setting for missed called or text. I like to have a sound notification for any missed call or text every 2 min. Repeat notification apps from google play store also not working for this phone. If anyone able to get this working please comment. I also like to have root access to install greenify app to improve battery life but do not know how to root this phone. Please comment if you know.

I will update the review if I find any issue later.

Update 12/31/2015: I was able to root the device following the instruction in this thread ""forum.xda-developers.com/showpost.php?p=64508454&postcount=41"". Just install ""Minimal ADB and Fastboot"" and exactly follow the instruction took me about 20 min to root.","4.0 out of 5 stars"

Let me cover the basics:

SCREEN - Full HD, 1080p screen. There's better screens out there, and you DON'T need them. 1080p at this size looks perfect, no pixels discernible. Having any more resolution is only good for a) marketing or b) draining your battery. Colors are nice, contrast is good, brightness is great - that said, the auto-brightness, when enabled, tends to err a bit on the darker side.

INTERNALS - This is not your usual Qualcomm Snapdragon, but the new contender Mediatek. I'll spare you the technical details: it's an 8-core CPU based on 8 ARM Cortex A-53 processors. They are not the fastest in the market, but they don't need to be. Paired with its 2GB of RAM, this phone is snappy. No app really takes ""long"" to load, everything (FB, Skype, Messenger, SMS, Chrome, Fibit, etc) loads in well under a second, with the occasional hiccup. There's only one negative to not having a Qualcomm CPU - there's no quickcharge here, so it does take longer (2h) to fully charge, instead of less than 1h on the newer Qualcomm processors. As long as you have enough time to charge it in the morning, or you charge it overnight, though, this is not a problem.

BATTERY - Used to be good from the beginning, then after the late January update it got better. Usually I'll finish the day with about %40-50 battery left and I charge it in the morning, never really getting it back to %100 but to %80-90 or so. A normal day of semi-heavy use (taking pictures, posting pictures, FB, twitter, instagram, lots of email, some chrome browsing, lots of podcast playing) consumes about half the capacity. Pretty great for the price compared to my previous Moto E LTE 2nd gen.

BODY - Very well built with metal, faux leather in the back and a very slim build. Compared to other $100 devices, this thing rocks. Compared to the Moto G 3rd gen, this is much better built, but lacks the water resistance. Feels nice in the hand and is very light. If your hands are on the smaller side like mine, though, holding with one hand isn't terribly comfortable, but that's a problem with any phone at this size.

CAMERA - 13mp on the back, 5mp on the front. I'm mostly impressed with the front camera: I've been so used to having absolutely awful cameras in the front, that this Blu taking quite decent selfies surprised me. The back camera is good, but nothing spectacular, certainly not on the level of an iPhone or a Galaxy S - but then again, this phone costs about %25 what the flagships cost. So, for the price it's being sold at, the camera is excellent. I challenge you to find a better one at this price range.
SOFTWARE - 5.1 Lollipop right off the bat, already updated in late January. We're supposedly getting 6.0 marshmallow by end of first quarter, so I'll be looking forward to that. I read in many forums that other users were skeptical about this, but so far Blu seems on top of their game. Apparently keeping their phones updated is a new priority for them and they're starting with the Life One X. We'll see if they hold to their promise (after Motorola betrayed my confidence by not updating my Moto E LTE 2nd Gen, I'm a bit cynical... but then again, this Blu is so much more device for the same money, so if it weren't updated, I wouldn't care so much because the phone is so nice to use). There are a couple quirks, like the fact that the phone ringtone refuses to change. For some reason, my podcast app (Pocket Casts) which worked fine on the Moto, can no longer remember where I paused the podcast, so I have to manually bring it back to where I was. I think this has to do with driver issues, so hopefully it'll be fixed in the 6.0 update, but again, even if it's not, these are minor inconveniences.

VERDICT - Great phone for little money. I keep hearing 2016 is the year of the rise of the cheap mid-range, where we'll get excellent devices like this for around $99-150. So far, this Blu is the only one I've seen make that a reality. You get good hardware, snappy performance, (hopefully) updated software to 6.0, beautiful screen, decent camera and all for a cheap price. I used to be a Windows Phone user until I jumped back into Android with the Moto E LTE 2nd Gen, and the Lumias give you so much LESS hardware for the money this Blu costs. Even Motorola, the value king lately, gives you way less for this price. Blu has a home-run with this Life One X.

Highly recommended.

UPDATE 5/7/2016: While he phone still works great, it's been nearly 2 months since the date BLU assured users that we'd get Marshmallow (Android 6.0). For that reason alone I'm dropping my review from 5 to 2 stars: false advertising is unacceptable and having based my purchase on the timely upgrade promise, I feel like I have been lied to.","2.0 out of 5 stars"

So, i am stuck with a phone that does not work as it should, with a company with no support. GREAT.

EDIT3: No answer from BLU yet.

EDIT2: Phone was reset to factory and the problems remains, ill ask for a refund (i have contacted blu, lets see how it goes).

EDIT: Ive dropped 1 star due that im having some kind of issue with the touchscreen, some kind of ghost touch that is bugging me. Ill try a factory reset to see how it goes.

Great value/performance.

Battery: with light use, 36-48h hours
Performance: great, not a single lag
Screen: it looks great, better than expected
Body and Build quality: great build quality except for the back cover, it could be better.
Features:
-knock on: a litle slow, it takes more than a second to turn the screen on
-knock off: very handly, works like a charm

Overall: for 99usd is a great great deal.","1.0 out of 5 stars"

Based on a full charge I was using the phone connected with Wi-Fi and I streamed about 2 hrs of video. Battery life only dropped about 15%. My previous phone (Nexus 4) would lose about 20% percent on similar usage pattern. The applications are quick to respond. I made a couple of calls and call clarity is great.
The phone LTE works great with T-mobile (I use the prepaid plan) in the Chicago metro area. I was averaging 50-80Mbps download and 20-30Mbps upload according to the speedtest.net app
The phone feels solidly built specially for the price point. The phone might not have the fingerprint scan sensor, NFC and other features found on the most expensive flagships, but for about $150 you get solid phone and wireless service.","5.0 out of 5 stars"

So here are the pros and cons I have found:

PROS:
-Fast
-Light
-Looks and feels great
-Screen is very responsive and doesn't show fingerprints easily
-Good camera, takes good close ups, not the best at night, but it's not bad nonetheless
-Good Battery Life, for it being an 8 core processor, it gets good life, not the best but will last all day into the night
-Charges FAST, this phone charges amazingly fast with the stock wall adapter, Takes about 30 minutes to charge from 60-70% after being used all day.
-Speaker is loud, not the clearest but works great as an alarm in the morning

CONS:
-When gaming or streaming videos, you eat the battery like nobody's business
-Screen is a battery eater as well
-Stock android can have compatability issues, such as with my Sony bluetooth car stereo, it doesn't buffer music properly for the radio works fine with all bluetooth headphones I have tested it with
-You MUST disable a LOT of stock google apps to increase battery life! (READ BELOW! LOTS OF PEOPLE HAVE THIS PROBLEM!)
-Wifi connectivity isn't the best, still good for the price though, mobile data is very speedy though

So In many reviews I have seen of this phone, at idle, it eats a lot of the battery. I had this problem in the first 3 days of having it, and I decided to figure out what ""System"" really was. Turns out, stock google apps like Books and Newsstand eat a lot of processing even when idle. I disabled most of google's stock apps like this due to me never going to use them. After I did this, I noticed a significant increase in battery life, and it's still doing fine to this day.

All in all, I love this phone, I hate iPhones and expensive android phones, this meets and exceeds my needs yet is still powerfull when I need it to be. I recommend it to everyone I see. If you have a teenager who's looking for a good looking and fast phone that he can game with, get this phone and get a gel case for it, I got one for 6$ shipped and it does a great job protecting the phone. The phone also comes with Gorilla Glass 3 installed, so the screen is well protected from breaks, however it comes with a screen protector just in case.

This phone comes with some earbuds that are also very decent, the mic was clear in calls, and the earbuds sounded good for normal music use. Mind you, they're nothing special, but they pack a punch on the low end of the frequency response, so that's a plus.

When it's all said and done, this phone is worth every cent, it has good cameras for selfies and for regular daytime pictures, also close ups. Fast and light, with a good looking and responsive screen. Lightweight with a good battery life and solid feel, this phone really gives the vibe of a much more expensive phone.","5.0 out of 5 stars"

I am just getting into the BLU phones and I am loving them so far, my last phone was a BLU studio X and it rocks, I gave it to my hubby when his old phone broke and he is hooked now too. Anyway I ended up with a brand new phone for about $150. It has more memory and ram than my studio and is super speedy on the fly, screen sensitivity is amazing and screen quality is high def.  Battery lasts a few days with a decent amount of calls, texts, and surfing FB and youtube daily.  Only things I liked about my other BLU better were how the power and volume buttons stuck out less and were on different sides, I keep bumping the power button, and the case, I really liked the jelly slip over case rather than the leather wallet style one.  Other than that Loves it!","5.0 out of 5 stars"

1) When plugged in charging it loses the charging connection randomly, it starts, then stops, starts then stops.

2) It has started dropping all my phone calls. If i call someone or someone calls me and about 30 seconds into the phone call it just drops the call. I can't even call anyone with this phone right now. I am awaiting an RMA and hopefully that resolves the issue.

Besides that its an okay phone. Great display, very bright, very snappy performance virtually no lag at all.  Camera is okay as well. For $150 its a great deal.

To start off i am not a paid reviewer, this my own review of the product. To start off a lot of the reviews that have been posted bashing this phone have nothing to do with this phone, one user posted a review about a completely different phone on this page, and another user gave a 1 star review because they had a negative experience with BLU in the past.

The features that are offered on this phone cannot be beat by anyone currently, i paid $99 for this phone when they were running the 3 day promotion. $99 for a almost pure android phone, WITH LTE, expendable storage, and a GOOD camera, that's all packed in a aluminum frame is under heard of. I have watched a few review videos and from what I've seen this phone is incredible for what it costs. Obviously this isn't a flagship killer, a iPhone 6s or galaxy s6 cost over $800 after tax's. I paid $107 for this phone after taxes. If this phone lasts me for a year it will save me money. But i think this is the best unlcoked budget phone out there, if you want a waterproof phone go for the Moto G (which i also have), but if you want a very visually pleasing budget phone that has LTE this is your choice.,","3.0 out of 5 stars"

Sadly, I missed the sale and had to pay $150 but that's still a good price for such an awesome phone. This might be the best budget phone you can get at the moment. The only downside I can find with it is that the battery life is OKAY at best. It's not the worst but it could be better. I think the longest it's lasted is around 5-6 hours at medium brightness but I was playing a lot of games and multitasking. Charging time takes around 3 hours, 4-5 if you're charging it through your computer.","5.0 out of 5 stars"

Annoying that cases and accessories aren't available yet. The flip case is annoying for single handed use. No issues with screen or functionality. I have to disable the WiFi to send MMS, which is common, but still annoying. I'll install a simple toggle.

I have had an issue with the stock alarm. It typically goes off 10-15 minutes late. This is a huge issue for me. I've read online and there seems to be an issue with power save and wake etc... I'm hoping to get this one resolved because I can't risk getting to work late.

*****UPDATE 1***** Even Timely alarm app isn't working. At this point, the phone won't fire the alarm at the right time.

++++update 2++++ alarm still doesn't fire with the power saver turned OFF. Getting much closer to a return. Down to 2 *'s and Blue hasn't replied to my request for assistance.

Charging is slow as mentioned previously. However, I'm not a heavy user, so topping it off isn't an issue.

I also find the power button, below the volume up down, annoying and wish it were on the top or above the power.

###Update 3### 1/8/16 Blu reached out to me a week after I asked for service/ assistance.They didn't offer any help, but simply a request to  re validate my need for them to get assistance. Of course, if I didn't respond within xx time, they would close the case. Very helpful, thanks to much.

^^^Final update^^^ 1/10/16 I'm returning the phone and going back to my MotoG. The alarm issue is something I consider a deal breaker. My attempts to work on it have failed. Blu hasn't assisted in any way. I'm not wasting more effort. Perhaps I have a dud, but without the company stepping up to assist me, I'll never know. Back to my MotoG for now.","2.0 out of 5 stars"

Factory unlocked and dual sim capable. Near stock Android with minimal skin interference. Micro SD card slot for extra storage. Gorilla glass and front flash. The list of features goes on and on.

For the money, this phone cannot be beat, heck, this phone could be sold for quite a bit more and still feel like a deal (shhhh...don't tell them!).
A few minor gripes: the charging port is upside down and offset, the LTE radio doesn't seem to be as strong as some others I've used, and non-removable battery.

It doesn't feel cheap. The screen is nicely beveled on the edges and the quality of the screen is very good, bright and colorful, with detail. It runs fast and doesn't lag, although I don't game on it. The only reason I give it three stars is because of the slow charging. The battery also doesn't last me a whole day, as some users claim. I am a power user, and I do use it as a hot spot a lot, so while I can understand the battery holds pretty good (and it got better after I the OTA update), the slow charging is reeaaally a drag.

Then there is also the included screen protector, which for some reason, doesn't cover the whole screen. If you are including a screen protector OEM style, it should fit the whole screen. I'm also not a fan of the included case, I'd rather have a skin or sleeve style rubber/tpu cover and not have to deal with flipping the cover open every time I want to use the phone.

Also, for some reason, even though it has band 12 coverage for T-Mobile, my girlfriends Moto E gets better data signal in the same house and also works better as a hot spot.

(smh)

So in the interim I was working with a Microsoft phone, which was nice, cheap, but it didn't have most of the apps I wanted due to it not being on the android platform. So, I turned to this as a option that I was willing to try at a low cost before throwing myself back into the $500+ price range that usually comes with a Samsung or iPhone. I have to say, I couldn't be happier.

It feel comfortable to me as a former Galaxy user. The apps and home screen navigate the same and I am loving the HD display. I use this phone for business too, and it works like a charm.

I've only had it for about three days, but I can generally get a good feel for a smartphone in that period of time. For a frame of reference, I have owned many smartphones on the iOS, Android, and Windows platforms. My most current of each is an iPhone 6, an ASUS ZenFone 2, and a Lumia 640.

Comparing it to the iPhone 6, from a hardware perspective this phone is quite comparable, NFC and fingerprint reader aside. Compared to the ZenFone 2, this feels like a more premium device and is more responsive, although again it lacks NFC.

OVERALL:
While there are some minor drawbacks, this is a great device for the money. It feels premium, the screen is nice and responsive, the skin on the OS is minimal and the features they've added are useful. For an everyday device, this certainly fits the bill.

PROS:
*Cost -- I was able to get this during the presale, and while it took a while to ship, the value for the price is outstanding
*Reception -- I am on T-Mobile in NYC and with the additional 12 band I get much better reception indoors and on the subway. Calls are clear on both ends.
*OS -- I am a fan of the Nexus devices and Motorola's approach to Android. BLU has taken the Motorola approach and I appreciate the minimal additions they've made.

CONS:
*Battery -- As many others have pointed out, the battery is slow to recharge regardless of what charger I use. However, the battery life is very good. I am a heavy user and am able to make it through most of the day on a single charge. To be safe, though, I do charge it during the day.
*Bluetooth -- As someone else mentioned, the Bluetooth transmitter on the device is a little on the weak side. Both on the street and in my house, I have experienced a lot of interference using both headphones and speakers. As a nice aside, it does work with Amazon's three-button headphones that were sold with the Fire Phone.
*Camera -- shutter is slower than I'm used to, but the photo quality is good and the camera app is nicely minimal and a step-up from the Motorola Camera app.
*No NFC -- I love using mobile payment and am unable to use on this device (alas).","4.0 out of 5 stars"

And then used it for 10 days and the  Gorilla glass broke when the phone fell out of my hands about 3 feet. Unbelievable!!!! What a joke this company is. I'm tired of working with them. I wonder if there is a way to get a refund. This is total BS.

This is an absolutely ridiculous product! I've used the phone for the past 4 months and have had several problems with it. I first was interested in this phone because of the fact that is was an unlocked dual sim phone with long battery life and the speed. But once it passed the 2 month mark I've started having problems with hanging and battery draining quickly. I uninstalled several programs to see if it will help but to no use.

Over the past week this phone battery drained out and now the phone is going through a never ending loop of initializing apps. The phone has restarted about 100 times but it gets to the initializing apps screen and then reaches up to 99 of 148 apps and then turns off. This has been driving me crazy and I'm just disgusted with the phone.

The battery on this phone is sealed and cannot be removed and so I cannot charge the phone separately.

I travel internationally and this phone has quit on me several times while on the road. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. I can't even find customer support to help me with this phone.","1.0 out of 5 stars"

But don't expect fast response time to this touch screen or processor, or easy use. It took multiple tries to even hook this up to wi-fi in my own home. It is slow and old fashioned. Not intuitive at all.

I understand there are people who will purchase this as their primary phone because they do not want to invest in an Iphone or a better Android phone. They will ultimately be disappointed, since the slowness of this phone will frustrate and annoy ANYONE. When you're paying for cell phone service and have an actual contract, having a phone like this is truly a waste of that very pricey service. I'd suggest a pay as you go phone rather than this.

That being said, it is a good phone in case of an emergency. However, I'd rely on my old HTC with a cracked screen before I went through the trouble of using this again.","2.0 out of 5 stars"

Matches performance with many phones that are several hundreds of dollars more. You can read the other reviews for specs and accolades, I'm going to point out the couple of things that are not top notch.

1) The battery charging takes a solid 4 hours from zero to charge, it appears this is normal, no quick charge on this phone no matter what charger you use. It's okay though because it lasts the day no problem.

2) The battery. Maybe it's just mine, love to hear from others but once my battery reaches the 10% level it drops like a rock to 1 percent in 5 minutes!! I'm doing nothing but watching the percentage tick down about every 30 seconds or so.

3) The camera is excellent for normal lighting such as outdoors or well lit indoors, not so good in low light- has a issue focusing in that stiuation.

Don't get me wrong it's a very good phone even for $150. All other specs are really top notch, no lag, very responsive, I get about 4-5 hours of screen on time.","4.0 out of 5 stars"

Disclaimer:  I've owned range of high-end phones, and currently have Blackberry Priv and LG V10 - both being ""High End"" phones.  So I *KNOW* my apples, and my oranges!

You wouldn't compare KIA to BMW, so why would you expect this phone to perform like an iPhone, Galaxy S6 or LG V10????

And interestingly, this ""cheap"" phone DOES PERFORM admirably well - not just for a phone at this price point, but also a phone that would cost a bit more.  While it is meant to be a secondary phone for me, I can see myself rely on it more as a primary phone!

Trust me, if you're using this phone to run processor-intensive games, then, of course this is not the phone for you.  Get a Galaxy Note or iPhone 6S plus.  But if you, like me, use a phone to do what has become a set of day-to-day tasks:  make calls and chat on Whatsapp, constantly open more than two email accounts, listen to music on my daily commute and workout, call Uber or Lyft twice or three times a day, read news from a couple of sources that constantly send alerts, and play chess during lunch, this phone is just perfect!

So let me just list the pros and cons which, again for a phone this price, is totally acceptable!!

First, the Cons - just so that they're out of the way:
-  There may be occasional slow down when scrolling up and down a web page when the internet connection is slow, but it's nothing I have not seen even on high end phones.
-  Cellular call sound isn't the best but still doable (in any case I use WhatsApp these days to make calls, and sound quality is much better with this, even on this phone)
-  Battery life, while not terrible, could use improvement.  But this I say about ALL the phones I've had, now and in the past, including Blackberry Priv (which has a horrible battery life by the way) and LG V10 (my ""last year"" phone that didn't fare as well on the battery department as it's older cousin LG G2).
-  Unremovable battery:  Why??  Especially when it's not a unibody phone, meaning you can open the back door.  Strange how they let you open the back of the phone only for the purpose of inserting or changing SIM cards and Micro SD card.

Pros:
-  Relatively smooth for typical day-to-day tasks
-  Light weight - compared to today's more Phablety standard - and decent design.  My worst nightmare is when I buy a phone from online only to find it looking like an iPhone!  Luckily, it doesn't.  It is more of a generic or non-descript style, but it is still elegant.
-  Camera:  I haven't tested it exhaustively, but under decent light condition (i.e. outdoor or indoor with good amount of light), pictures turn out decent.  Funny how the HDR option has to be selected manually all the time (unless I haven't figured out how to set it automatically), but it does help improve extreme lighting condition like other phones do.  I have seen much better Selfies from other phones, especially Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge and the ""camera king"" LG V10.  But, again, those phones cost $600+++++.

All in all, this is a great phone indeed!!  I highly recommend it, even as a primary phone.","5.0 out of 5 stars"

Today I did a reset and after this it charged as normal - in about 4 hours.  It is now 3 hours since charging and the battery level is at 68% after a couple phone calls a few Whatsapp messages and getting the phone back to the state before resetting by downloading about 50 apps.

Loving the phone. I've read every single review here on amazon. So far the only defect that I've noticed is poor fit and finish in the back cover in the corner where you are supposed to pry it opened. But the leather back cover that also came in the box does not have this issue.

As others have noticed, swipes sometimes get registered as clicks, but I think that's the screen protector to blame.

Also, realize that there are two screen protectors included. One is already installed. There are specifications listed on it, but they are a separate sticker - pulling it off with a razor blade leaves you with a factory installed screen protector - nice.

A note on battery. I've installed my 20 or so basic apps (Facebook, Whatsup, etc), left wi-fi on (but no sim card yet) - overnight the battery has dropped from 89% to 84% percent. I say that's awesome.

Battery life. This phone lasts all day, and then some. I use it for texting, Spotify in the car, phone calls, and Strava. I always have battery left at the end of the day. As far as the ""slow charging"". It is not a problem for me. I  plug my phone in when I go to bed

Ram is adequate to run lots of apps at once. Screen is bright and responsive, build quality is good, battery performance is good. The back is textured and grippy.

Everything seems to be well thought out, the Blu design and software team really did an excellent job.

The only thing noticably different from a premium phone is the camera, which is perfectly acceptable for snaps in good light but won't be confused with an iPhone 6 camera. And really, an iPhone 6 camera is still a long way from a high quality camera anyway.

We'll have to see about durability. Will the buttons and ports hold up? Will the components hold up to day to day banging?

This device works decently for basic phone functions, under certain circumstances. It can call, text, and surf the web, as long as it is charged, cool, and in solid cell service. It has a decent battery life, so long as you do not let the battery run out. When the battery drops to 0%, one of two things happens. Either the phone restarts, showing anywhere from 25% to 100% battery life, and lasts as long as it normally would on that charge, or the phone gets stuck in an almost endless cycle of powering on and off. I've had to go an entire day (24 hours) without my phone because it shut off due to lack of battery, charged just enough to try and turn itself back on, and then used all of this charge, in the process of turning on, only to die again, before the restart finished. there is no way to escape this cycle, besides leaving the phone on a charger, until it decides to stop turning itself on. Other issues include, not being able to send mms, or access the internet in anything less than optimal cell service (which could somehow be a carrier problem,) Having a very shaky bluetooth connection, that drops and stutters constantly (sometimes at regular intervals,) and a bit of sluggishness (honestly less than I'd expect from a phone of this price.) Otherwise the phone is functional, and the 'leather' flip case that comes with it has saved the screen from a few drops. If the company fixes/replaces my likely defective model, I'll definitely update the star rating.","1.0 out of 5 stars"

1.using it is very smooth.
2.Highly responsive
3. Very light and great screen resolution
Cons
1. Battery acts up sometimes. If I am using a non-blu charger sometimes it gets charged without any issues.  But sometimes it charges very slowly. It also goes from full charge to no charge within 4-5 hours inspite of minimal usage.
2. Camera is bad. Have never seen a worse camera.
3. When I am on a call the screen doesn't go to sleep. So some random app gets opened when my cheek touches the screen.

After installing a battery saver app the battery life has been holding up well. If the battery acts up again in the next few days it is going back. If not I can give it a 4 star.

After using it for a month:
I have gotten used to talking in this phone without rubbing my cheek on it. The battery problem is not that bad for me to return it.  While charging it decreases battery life sometimes.  And suddenly jump from 2%-100% which is weird but the price of the phone and other spectacular features of this phone makes up for the weird battery and poor camera.","4.0 out of 5 stars"

(just like the MOTO G 3rd) I got the phone this morning but since today is my day off from school and work i had the chance to put some heavy usage on it and would like to provide some feed back for anyone looking at this device.  I got the phone around 10am this morning and upon the first start up i found that it only had 2% battery on the unit.  So the most logical thing would be to plug it into my fast charger (Anker 40w unit with a known good cable) and started installing my apps.  After about 30-45 mins of updating and downloading i found out that the battery level has dropped down to 1%.  Although i would admit that everything was done with the screen on but the battery level should at least move up 4-5 percent over the time it has been plugged in.  Long story short with my inline amp meter i found out that it was only charging at .5-.6 amps (slow charging).  The only way i could get this phone to charge at a normal speed was with its factory charger.  Below are the quick Good Vs. Bad points of this device.

The good:
Quick camera and decent pictures.
Fast and solid gps signal.
Great user interface with a bunch of hidden short cuts to make everything easier.
(smart locks, smart device manager for quick phone unlock, double tap to wake)
great battery life. (GPS, BT and pandora was on for an hour and only consume 15% battery )

The bad:
Super slow charging (.5 amp draw vs 1.0 amp of a normal phone)
Creaky back with the leather case.
Inconsistent ""Ok Google""  activation (i use this feature a lot)
Smart gesture only seems to work if the phone unlock.

The pictures i have attached are the different charging amp reading with the Anker 40w charger comparing with the factory charger. (cable is the same)","4.0 out of 5 stars"

My last review stands. It's been pretty durable; I ordered the wrong case and never ended up with one that fit, and I have yet to scratch the screen or break the phone. My biggest complaint is the battery life, but I have gotten tons of improvement by turning on power saving and adaptive brightness, and by turning off notifications for apps that don't need it - if you're going to be out for the day, turning the brightness down and turning on power saving will definitely get you through the day, even with frequent use. I would prefer a removable battery, but I've had good luck with the one installed. I've had issues with swyping; sometimes the keyboard needs extra pressure. There's an issue with changing the default ring tones, but this is easily worked around by creating a new sound profile and selecting it as active.

The octacore processor is designed for great battery availability with consistent performance, screen on time is great like 6 hours. HD display consumes less power than quad hd so that's good for battery availability and it's still sharp, images and videos are great. Software is super clean u decide wat to do with ur phone ,u can customize it to ur needs, marshmallow update if that happens soon will be sweet & I heared BLU has promised update in q1 2016. Call quality, speaker quality are good. Have tested both the SIM card slots both had 4g LTE capabilities with tmobile. It's super light because of the aluminium build and plastic combination and I guess non removable battery weighs less than removable one. Screen touch feel is smooth and pls don't use the screen protector that comes with it. I like the note 4 like back cover which helps for non slippery.

 It doenot have NFC or a very good speaker (jbl fronfacing dual speakers) or upside down screen all these are available in Alcatel idol 3. I would buy Alcatel which is 30$ more but since I got blu for 99 It's worth it.

I'm not going to go over the specs, as other reviewers have covered those well.

THE GOOD:
* The screen is full HD with great color depth.  You aren't going to find a better screen at this price
* The processor and memory mean that pretty much any app you throw at it will run fine. I've run games, projection apps, and had multiple tabs open, and never had problems
* It will actually use an SD card as your main installation medium.  I put a 32GB card in, so now I have plenty of space for all the apps I could want.  Most android devices I've used complain much more about installing apps to the card.
* Very little bloatware.  They did install the Amazon appstore in addition to the Google Play store, so you can get a ton of paid software for free
*BLU Support:  I had issues with my phone at first (See FIXES below), and called BLU for help.  I got a real person right away.  They gave me instructions on how to potentially fix my phone, and started the return process in case it didn't work.  They then followed up with me a day later to make sure everything worked out.

THE ADEQUATE:
* The camera isn't anything special.  It takes nice enough photos, but doesn't like the dark.
*Reception and sound quality aren't anything to write home about, but are equal to other phones I've had.
THE BAD:
* The digitizer (the part that registers your touch) gets a little oversensitive sometimes and registers swipes a a series of clicks.  It's not enough to ruin the phone experience, but it's what lost the phone the one star that it lost.
* Initially, the phone would reset every time it rang.  BLU Support helped me out with that though.
* If you use Smart Awake, your phone screen may turn on when you're talking on it. Keep the included case closed to stop that from happening.

FIXES:
There are a couple of things that were fixed:
* Battery charge slowness:  Apparently this was software-related, as the OTA update from BLU seems to have completely fixed it.
* Resetting issue.  My phone reset each time it rang.  A factory reset completely fixed it though.

OVERALL:
This is a great phone for the money.  You can buy it with confidence.","4.0 out of 5 stars"

Given that it's unlocked, capable of dual SIM cards, and can take an extra SD chip to increase storage up from a nice 16GB already onboard, this phone will work. There are three separate slots, two for microSIMs and one for MicroSD.

I installed the free app ""Z-Device Test"" and the specs tested out as advertised (noting that amount of memory is never exact when expressed in Gbytes - e.g., 1.87 GB is rounded up to 2 GB of RAM). Also, this does NOT have NFC capability installed.

Performance in hand was fairly snappy with an AArch64 processor with 8 cores that can run at 1.30 GHz. When I test this just as a wifi Android device I have no issues at all with playing videos, pulling up street view on Google Maps, and taking pictures and videos. Almost all apps I've installed run fine, with one exception: this is not rated for, and does not work with, Google Cardboard. I was actually able to look at some stills in 3D with a Google Cardboard headset, but the Cardboard app itself is incompatible with this phone. That is NOT a deal breaker, but thought I should note it. Two different apps tell me this phone does not have a gyro, even though I know of one reputable site that lists that it does have one.

I actually prefer my Moto-G in my pocket. This phone is more along the size of an Apple 6, actually a bit larger. The screen weighs in at 1776 x 1080 pixels (Z-Device Test) and is visible from all angles.

This comes with a screen protector which I ignored (just don't like them) and a very nice snap in case with window for seeing time and pop up announcements.

Greatest phone ever? Nah. Excellent over all phone for the price? Definitely.

UPDATE 16 DECEMBER 2015 (just later in the day):

Does NOT have . . .

What had kept me away from more modern smart phones was the ridiculous prices associated with most of them, but after some recent trips abroad, I decided it might be time to upgrade and started looking around.  I was looking at the Studio Energy 2 and was close to making a purchase when this little baby rolled out.  I Purchased it for $150 (no, I was not lucky enough to get in on the $100 initial pricing).  I wasn't sure what I'd get for something considered to be a budget phone, but this highly exceeded my expectations.  I would even say they were blown away.  And being someone who take pride in being frugal, I am very pleased with how much value is packed into this phone for $150.  The 5.2"" screen is a nice size, not too big, not too small and still fits right in my side pocket of my carpenter jeans without sticking out of the top.  The 1080x1920 makes videos look fantastic, and I haven't noticed it struggling to keep up with anything I do although I don't really do a lot of high demand activities on my phone.  I haven't noticed any call quality issues or terrible battery life.  I looped a video on power saving mode for 3hrs 40mins, and it took the battery from 100% to 73%.  That seems alright to me, but different people may have different expectations.  I get about 3 days out of the battery with moderate daily usage.  Also, the battery didn't get very warm after that long video play back.  I haven't experienced any problems of it having trouble maintaining wifi connections either.  It doesn't have quick charge capabilities.  Not an issue for me as I can just plug it in if it is almost dead when I go to sleep and wake up to a fully charged phone.  It takes just a little under 6 hours to go from 1% to 100% battery.  I'd definitely recommend this phone to anyone who wants a capable, modern smartphone, but doesn't want to break the bank.  I am using this phone with StraightTalk.

PROS:
-Great looking, responsive screen
-Nice size
-Battery life (subjective based on user)
-Textured back cover
-Comes with headphones, charging cable, screen protector and case
-Doesn't come loaded with a lot of bloatware
-Supports 5 different 4G LTE bands
-Gorilla Glass 3
-Price!

CONS:
-No quick charge capabilities

The phone doesn't have a fingerprint reader, 3D touch, or NFC payment, but I think if my iPhone broke today, I'd just buy another one of these for myself, save $850, and never notice the difference. I think maybe Apple is in deep deep trouble as I can't be the only one starting to feel this way.","5.0 out of 5 stars"

I received my replacement phone, and while the battery problem isn't as bad, it is still there.  Where my original phone's battery started ""crashing"" at about 10% indicated battery life, the replacement starts crashing at about 6% battery life.

This is concerning.  The discharge characteristics of lithium batteries is well understood, so it should be easy to have your phone display a linear % remaining indication.  There are 3 possible reasons this is not happening on the 2 phones I've evaluated:

1) The battery is defective, in which case it could be a safety hazard.

2) The voltage monitor in the phone is not adjusted properly, in which case there could be a potential battery safety issue.

3) The phone firmware could be faulty.  This could be fixed by a firmware upgrade, but if it isn't, there is a potential battery safety issue.

Given that a number of other reviewers have also identified this problem, I expect it's pervasive on this model.  I'd bet that others, if they look for it, will also confirm it as a problem.  It's really sad given that other than this battery issue, it's really a fine phone for the money.

***************************************************
ORIGINAL REVIEW:

I received a defective unit due to battery issues, which I'll describe in a moment.

I had a change to play with the phone some before returning it.  The phone overall appearance is damned good.  As mentioned in other posts, the plastic back looks a bit cheap, but the rest looks great.  The display is lovely for a budget phone...actually even for a mid-upper range phone!  It had a slight color shift which has been described in other posts, but I believe it's correctable.  It's not major issue, however.  I played some video that I loaded, & it played smoothly.  Surfing was a breeze, although I wish it had the 5GHz wireless band covered.  That's one of the cost compromises.

The problem with the battery had to do with end-of-charge life.  Normally a phone should display the % of battery life left as a linear function of time left.  50% means you've got 50% time left, assuming you are doing the same thing in the last 50% that you did in the first 50%.  Likewise, if it shows 10% left, you should have 10% more time remaining.

My copy didn't do that.  I was watching a video as the % dropped linearly with time, until I hit about 10%...then the indicated % fell like a rock.  In no time, the battery went down...9...8...7...6...5...4...3, so I quickly shut it down.  I had broken in the battery properly, so this was not a good sign.  I recharged (& yes, reports of slow charging, even with a 2-amp capable charger are correct) it fully, letting it go 5 hours after it indicated full so it would really be full with a trickle charge.

I then ran the Geekbench 3 battery test.  After running the test, it gave a readout of % vs time, & that test confirmed what I saw.  The % fell like a rock below about 10%.

So the phone is being returned.  Hopefully the replacement won't have this battery issue.","2.0 out of 5 stars"

However, I have a minor issue with the touch responsiveness. It seems there is a lag sometimes and the touch is not recognized, not sure if is an issue with the keyboard app. I will explore more on this issue.","5.0 out of 5 stars"

Blu released a update that fixed the ringtone issue a day ago.  Everything seems to be working but I have read that custom ringtones will only work if you create a custom audio profile in your audio settings. I haven't tested this yet.
But with my custom sound profile things seem to be working... They released this just two days before I was going to return the phone.

Like I said below,  besides this issue, the phone is pretty incredible. For the price, or even for $250, I really don't think it can be beat!

I would easily give a 5 star rating but I'm still a little weary after this.

The only possible concerns I kinda would have buying the phone are:
1) speaker volume is pretty low.
2) seems to connect poorly to Wi-Fi... Could be wrong about that?
These are minor concerns.

I was amazed with the phone when I first got it but there is one MASSIVE problem- no matter how many times I set a custom ringtone the phone reverts back to one of the built-in, and rather annoying, ringtones.
The reason I prefer android phones is because I can customize everything!

BLU's customer service is impressively bad, but I'm waiting to hear if they a fix for this or if the company just forgot that phones have been using custom ringtones since the late 1990's!!!!
I would be really bummed to have to return it, but if I'm stuck with there awful ringtones, then the phone is junk.

The only other downsides are:
1.) No cases for the phone on the market.
2.) No screen protectors on the market.
-In both instances, BLU provides a cheap screen protector and a substitute back with cheap cover that they call a case.

The earpiece is a little on the quiet side but I think it charges pretty fast actually.

Overall it's still a great deal, but if you are like me and HAVE be able to load your own ringtone I'd likely be looking elsewhere.
I'll update this if I can find a work-around or if BLU ever follows up with me.

Update: caveats
1.) You can't change the ringtone or voicemail  notification and BLU customer service is apparently uninterested in the issue.
2.) the phone doesn't seem to be able to connect to Wi-Fi correctly.

I wasted $100, I wouldn't buy this phone or anything from BLU.","3.0 out of 5 stars"

I bought this for my daughter as an alternative to wasting money on an iPod and to get her an entry-level phone. With the native ability to host a 64GB microSD card, this thing can hold a ton of music. Also, to my surprise, this phone has an FM receiver built in that uses the included headphone wires as an antenna to capture over-the-air broadcasts and comes with an FM tuner app that lets you save your favorite FM stations. Initial setup was easy and I'm very impressed with the fact that this is near-stock Android and includes a lot of customization. As one example, you can double-tap the screen to wake the phone, which eliminates the need to press the power button. It does come with some Amazon apps pre-loaded, but I would not call these bloatware in the traditional sense, as you can uninstall them, not just disable them. Aside from the typical included charger, you also get a plastic screen protector and a professional, window-type case that rivals the Samsung S-View cases for their flagship phones. The included case integrates (and replaces) the back of the phone and was of much higher quality than I expected.

The 2016 Blu Life One X is a sub $200 phone that offers decent performance, but one that is marred by a few issues.

Let's start off with the phone itself.  The build quality of this phone is quite good; it feels sturdy in the hand, the buttons are placed in a logical location, and the Gorilla Glass 3 seems to hold up to the everyday rigors of life.  The plastic back detaches fairly easily and exposes the 2 Sims card slots along with the dedicated MicroSD slot.  It's worth noting that the 2nd SIM slot can also accommodate a 2nd MicroSD card.  Specs list these MicroSD slots as being able to accommodate up to a 64 Gig SDXC card, but I have not tested as I only have a 32gig card.  Unfortunately, this also exposes the battery as being integrated into the phone; making a battery swap impossible. (More on this later)

The screen is a gorgeous 1080p with good viewing angles and decent color reproduction, which can be further tweaked in the settings so you can get your color saturation to your liking.  The screen is nearly on par with flagship phones from about 1-2 years ago (The Note 3 for example), not something you would expect on a phone this inexpensive.  While you don't get the 2k or 4k resolution of the current flagship phones, the 1080p resolution is more than enough for it's 5.2"" size.

With such a wonderful screen and good build quality, sacrifices needed to be made somewhere.  In the case of the Blu Life One X 2016, that comes in the form of a MediaTek processor and a lesser Mali GPU.  While a majority of phones seem to be powered by Snapdragon processors, Blu makes due with an Octocore MediaTek running at 1.3 Ghz.  Don't let the ""octocore"" fool you, this phone is not a speed demon.  During testing, several games (Walking War Robots, Star Trek Timelines) dropped enough frames to be noticeable.  Do not expect to be running the newest games smoothly on this phone during it's lifespan.  I am unsure if this performance is related more to the Mali 270 GPU or the MediaTek processor.  Less intensive, 2D games show no problem, so your game of Just 10 Taps or Candy Crush won't be affected.  For everyday performance, this processor/GPU mated with just under 2GB of RAM will serve you just fine.

Out of the box, the phone runs Android 5.1 in just about as close to a stock configuration as possible.  Blu promises an update to Marshmallow; however I would not hold my breath as they have previously broken promises of updates (That being said, they have improved on this.)  Performance is smooth in normal tasks, however the phone can be slowed with excessive use of tabs in Chrome.  Video at 1080p plays beautifully with no stuttering.

With an inexpensive phone, two trade offs are usually made.  The first being the screen (Which is NOT a tradeoff on this phone) and the second being the camera.  I am happy to report that the camera in the Blu Life One X 2016 is NOT a tradeoff.  While you will not get the quality of shots you would with a recent iPhone, the 13MP camera on the Life One X 2016 is no slouch.  The lack of optical image stabilization means you need to be a bit more steady with your hands, but the camera takes good quality shots, even at night.  The shutter response time could be improved, however nothing about the main camera is a deal breaker; in fact the camera is quite impressive for the price point.

The Life One X 2016 isn't without its issues, and depending on your use, these could be a deal breaker.  First, the 2900mah battery takes FOREVER to charge.  I have used multiple chargers, multiple cables, and this phone still charges ludicriously slow.  On average, I am getting about 10% per hour.  I have never seen a phone charge so slowly.  This is problem is compounded by the lack of a removable battery.  I have heard reports from other owners that they are experiencing the same issues, leading me to believe that this is just a trait of the phone and not a bad unit.  For my use case, this is annoying, but not a deal breaker.  The larger issue I have with this phone is this.  The alarm is completely unreliable.  For one week I had no issue with the alarm, however the past few days have nearly made me late for work.  The alarm will engage, but will NOT actually play the alarm sound.  I have turned up the volume in the Clock app, checked the vibrate box, deleted and reset the alarm.  There is no rhyme or reason to it.  Just last night I played for 20 minutes until the alarms worked as it was supposed to.  Satisfied, I went to bed.  Instead of waking me up at 5am as it was supposed to, the alarm again engaged, but played no sounds and it did not vibrate.  This problem has left me flabbergasted.  There is no rhyme or reason to the alarm failure.  After consulting with other Life One X 2016 owners, I am again led to believe that this is not an isolated problem, but another quirk with this phone.  As with the battery issue, my use case does not preclude this from being my main phone, but it may very well preclude it from yours.","4.0 out of 5 stars"

My phone before the One Touch was a HTC Droid Incredible II which I absolutely adored (the camera on it was stellar). I hadn't had a reasonably new phone (one that was released within a couple months of me purchasing it) in a long, long time. So I'd been used to outdated and often no-longer-updated apps, operating systems, and the like.

I really, really love my Life One X.

It's snappy and responsive and easy to use. The size was a little cumbersome for me, initially, as both my Incredible II and One Touch Fierce were smaller models and I could easily reach the whole screen with one hand. That's not always possible with the Life One X, but it's a small price to pay.

I do use a lot of apps - including customization apps to make my screen look better (things like Go Launcher, Go Locker, and Zooper widgets), so those kinds of things do eat some some memory, but even so, my apps run quickly and only things like heavier games tend to give me a little lag.

My only major complaint is one that's echoed in other reviews:

The battery life isn't stellar and it takes a long time to recharge.

I use my phone from when I wake up in the morning until I fall asleep at night. I use it to socialize with friends or to play games on. I use it at work, to snap pictures of things, or to utilize things like Google Drive and Trello for tasks and projects. I use it for bus schedules, for grocery lists, for shopping apps, the whole gamut.

When I take my phone off the charger in the morning, I can expect it to drop 1-2% almost immediately. In the time reading things on my way to work I can expect probably another 8-10% drop. If I'm using it a lot at work, I'll usually be down to about 30-40% by the time I leave. That remaining battery life goes fast and if I have to run errands after work and I don't have a portable charger, it'll be bottoming out on the bus ride home for the night.

I've learned to keep a portable USB charger fully charged and handy, as well as an extra USB cable and adapter in my bag just to be safe.

Some people may not used their phone as heavily as I do and they'll probably be more content with the battery life. I may also have higher expectations for how long my battery should last, as well. But be aware that this phone does take a long time to charge and battery life could be better.

My other complaints are minor -

First, I think the camera could be better, but it's still a GREAT camera in comparison to the One Touch Fierce. Bright scenes are often blown out, light-wise, and need to be tweaked with the Professional camera setting (lowering the exposure usually does the trick). But this IS a budget phone and I don't expect iPhone levels of camera quality. I just wish I could find a newer phone with as nice of a camera as my Incredible II had.

Secondly, no matter how many times you select the SD card as the default write disk (where apps and such are downloaded and installed to), it will not do it. Maybe it puts my downloads and photos there? But I am constantly having to go into my settings and into the app settings and moving apps individually to my SD card. It's not the worst thing, but it's mildly annoying because it ALSO has to be done whenever an app updates. For people like myself, who have a more intermediate knowledge of cellphones and write disks and stuff, it's not so bad. But I could see how someone could get confused and frustrated with their phone storage filling up quickly and not understanding why that's happening when they also have a 32gb SD card, as well. If there's a way around this issue, I'm happy to hear it. Maybe I've overlooked a setting or somesuch.

For $150 this phone is a dream. I just bought a second one for my husband, as well.","4.0 out of 5 stars"

At least texting still works so I'm not completely in the dark.

After using the phone for a few weeks, I find it to be just ok.
It does have some problems, the touch sensor is not the best and picks up on the smallest of touches causing you to miss-click while trying to scroll, battery life is also not the best I find myself having to charge the phone once per day as opposed to once a week with my nexus under similar usage.

The phone comes with a ton of bloatware, my first suggestion is to reinstall a fresh copy of android.

Overall it's again an ok phone, If you really wanted it I would suggest waiting till the price goes down a bit more as the addition of ads to the installed OS should not warrant the additional $50 price tag that it was raised to from the starting value of $99 on pre sales.","1.0 out of 5 stars"

Pros:
- Speedy, apps open fast. Switching between apps is a breeze.
- Display is amazing for a $150 phone. Icons looks crisp, text looks clear, colors are vivid.
- The size is just perfect for watching videos, and also perfect for making calls. Not too big, not too small.
- Internal storage is pretty good for all my apps. (I have a lot of apps)
- The front camera takes some great selfies! =)
- The rear camera takes some good pictures as well

Cons
- Battery life is pretty bad.I leave for work with a full battery and barely use the phone during the days and the battery is less than 60% when I reach home about 9 hrs later =(. If I use the phone a lot then it the battery goes down to 80+ percent in about 30 minutes =(. (Also, the battery takes long to charge, approximately 3 hrs)

Overall, this phone is well worth the $150, it feels great in the hands, it feels great to use and it performs and looks amazing.

I have had a number of issues with this phone, such as the battery draining very quickly when not in use (sometimes by as much as 50% overnight.) I had bought two of these, each is slightly different. One has a creaky backplate, the other does not, even if you swap them.  My power button suddenly popped off when I pressed it one day. I had to contact Blu support as it was just over the 30 day return period from Amazon.  After an hour on the phone, they told me that I must pay to ship it back to them, and that it would take 20+ days before I'd receive my phone back, and that everything on it would be erased.  I will be without a phone for at least two thirds of a month now.  Their service is awful, and while the phone seems nice initially, they are ultimately low quality re-branded phones (that is, Blu does not make or design the phones, they buy them from a Chinese factory and put their name on it. This phone is identical to the Miramax Canvas 5 and the Wiko Fever.)
Blu phones are inexpensive for a reason.

Also, be warned that Blu's software has an audio profile that resets when you reboot. What this means is, if you leave your phone in vibrate mode, and restart it, when you turn your phone back on, your alarm volume is turned all the way down. You have to double check your alarm volume every time you use set the alarm.","1.0 out of 5 stars"

Shipping : 2/5
It took me just over a month to receive the item. I was expecting to wait 2-3 weeks, but I still wanted to receive by the latest possible expected delivery date, I didn't. They screwed up big time here.

Overall physical design: 4.5 / 5
I love how large but still thin, and light this device is, and definitely much better than my galaxy s3.

Speed and Snappiness : 5/5
This is the fastest phone I've ever used, and I see no lag whatsoever, just great.

Screen : 4/5
The screen is gorgeous but there are some issues. Sometimes, the screen touch does not register, and it is unnaturally smooth. I definitely liked the iphone's screen better, and my galaxy s3 felt better although didn't look as good.

Software : 3/5
The launcher and Android 5 is great but it has serious flaws like unresponsive (locked) screen, blind spots (like the upper left ""back"" button does not work!). Too often, you'd touch screen while talking and mute the conversation, or press the speaker button etc. Some of these are solved by using another launcher, but not all.

Camera: 2/5
This is probably the worst camera I have seen lately. My older phone (Galaxy S3) had a much better camera than this. Also the software is too limited.

Wi-fi : 5/5
I had no problems whatsoever, everything seemed flawless.

Battery : 4.5 / 5
The battery was initially not very good, it went from 100% to 80% in 1 hour, but still gone for the whole day. However, after a few days of use, I installed other, less resource-intensive launchers, and restricted the number of active apps to 2. Now, the same pattern continues, battery drains rather quickly the first hour but drops to 90% instead of 80%, and after a light daily use from 8am to 5pm, it still sits around 70%, which is way better than my galaxy s3 (which is typically at 40% at the same time frame).

At this stage, I cannot recommend this phone for $150 (maybe for $100) but practically all of the issues could be solved with some tweaks, which then would be worth $200 (especially with a much better camera).","4.0 out of 5 stars"

Thanks to a comment on the original review by 'bob', I have been able to get a custom ringtone to work; however, still not 5 stars because I shouldn't have to use a work-around to get a basic feature such as custom mp3 ringtones to work.

Here's a copy/paste from bob's comment for how to get custom ringtones to work:
Go into Settings --> Sound & notification. There's a menu in the upper right hand corner. Click it and select Add Audio Profile. I named mine My Ringtones. Just give it a name. From this new profile, you can set any ring tone you like.

=== END EDIT ===

I really like this device; however, there is a bug with custom ringtones.  The device will let you select a custom ringtone (provided you have saved the mp3 or ogg file in the correct location), but when a call comes in it just uses the default Blu Ringtone 4 sound. Blu has yet to acknowledge this bug.

Other than the bug, I've had no problems. Battery life is better than the Studio X I was previously using (5-6 hrs screen on time with medium-heavy usage). Call volume is a little on the quiet side, but others have said it is loud enough, so maybe that is just me. The rear speaker is definitely too quiet and low quality.

The best thing about this phone is the display: nice and large, bright even with the brightness slider almost all the way down, and super-clear.

Overall, if it weren't for the custom-ringtone bug - 5 stars. Until that is fixed: 3 stars (-2 since that is such a basic feature and should *just work*).","3.0 out of 5 stars"

We have been using TracFone for our middle schooler - they have a ""Bring your own phone"" option that cost us $4 for the SIM card and nothing to transfer over from a new or existing account.  For $19.99 we get 3 months of service with 3x60=180 minutes, but more importantly, 180 mb data which is far more than you need for unlimited text messages via Lime or WhatsApp.  We are using the BLU Life One X with the GSM chip which puts us on the AT&T network.

The phone itself is a very powerful smartphone.  The one we were using before (LG Optimus Fuel) had so much lag it was nearly impossible for the kids to play games on.  The Life One X has more than enough power that on games like Subway Surfers or Piano Tiles are fine.  the 1080P screen is as sharp and clear as my Samsung Galaxy S5.  Screen is Gorilla Glass and even came with a screen protector.

I'd say that on the surface the Life One X is as powerful as my 2-year old Galaxy S5.

Although the battery is not removable, there is a MicroSD slot.  There's also a second SIM card so in theory it can be used with 2 services at the same time, if you had 2 different phone numbers you used (for example a business line and a personal line)

The phone is as thin as my Samsung Galaxy S5, but a bit taller due to a thicker bezel on the top and bottom.

I'm pretty amazed that you can get this much power at this price - If I trashed my S5 tomorrow, I'd seriously consider the Life One X over a refurb S5.","5.0 out of 5 stars"

Now here we have the Life One X. This phone is Amazing! I am all about budget friendly tech and this device oozes it! Now this phone is good enough for a main phone but can be purchased for a back up phone. I bought the white version and I will go over all the pros and cons. Now my cons can easily be over looked for the price but I wouldn't be giving you guys a fair review if I had no cons, now would I ? :)

Pros:
Price (for what you are getting its very very worth the money)
Very snappy phone  Mediatek 6753 1.3GHz Octa-Core processor 2GB ram (speed through apps and loading/ multi tasking)
5.2 inch screen with full hd 420 ppi (now the screen is down right beautiful, sharp picture, saturated color, bright great in sun light!)
4G LTE (now i am in USA with t-mobile so that may be different for your carrier)
Camera is very very Good ( 13 mp rear shooter 5mp selfie, software is smoother and has tons of camera modes)
Dual sim (a standard for Blu phones, honestly every phone should have it)
Running Android Lollipop 5.1 out of the box (very smooth stock android feel)
Comes with case and screen protector (this phone has a flip cover case that attaches to the back of the phone, premium look)
Micro SD up to 64 GB (come with 16GB internal so its not bad for lite downloaders)
HD 1080p video (can shoot great videos in good lighting)
Bluetooth
Wifi
Looks like a iPhone/ Samsung hybrid (giving you the best idea of to me what it looks like)
Light weight (for the size it fits good in your pocket)

Cons:
Battery (now i used this phone for a week straight and the battery dose deplete rather fast, I honesty feel it is because of  management and the screen size. I have bigger phones that last longer.)
Speaker (not the best, kinda small but it is usable, also located on back of phone)
Back of phone (now this only applies to the white version, the back is a textured faux leather material, I would recommend buying the black version because the white got dirty within a week making you want to switch to the flip cover case. The black probably gets less dirty.
Non removable battery (some like this some do not, with the battery being weak it would of been nice)

Overall this phone fantastic specs for the price! Blu really is stepping up their game for the quality of budget smart phones. I really can seem them becoming the leader in that category. For the price you pay you get a great device, that if you were not told is was a $150 phone you would not be able to tell the difference. I highly highly recommend this phone, now also company that with the quick service of amazon and you easily have a certified win!","5.0 out of 5 stars"

All I needed to make it work was a Tracfone LTE GSM SIM and it activated/transfered without issues in a matter of minutes. The APN was auto configured from the get go and the LTE speeds are blazing fast. I get 35mbps+ down and 9mbps up no problem, which is nearly 2x my home broadband speed. I've had over 2 weeks to use the device and have been impressed by it overall. It offers compelling specs and design for the price, and it certainly looks much more expensive than it really is. The curved edge laminated 1080p display is stunning (despite its slight blue tint) and the metal frame coupled with the soft touch backplate looks and feels rather nice. The phone is very snappy/responsive for majority of everyday tasks and the software experience is nice and clean (kudos BLU for near stock experience). That said, it is far from perfect, and it's a folly thinking this is a flagship, or even a high-end, smartphone killer.

Why? Well, for one, while it does excel at the ""smart"" stuff (e.g. text/apps/browsing/email and other Android features), it is hit or miss at the ""phone"" stuff. More specifically, the earpiece and loudspeaker are too quiet, the vibration motor is too weak, the proximity sensor is too finicky (screen would sporadically turn back on, with my face pressing random buttons on a call) and the cellular signal is weaker than its peers (e.g. Moto G 2015, or even the cheaper Moto E). The camera is nothing to brag about, even considering the price. It struggles in low light, is slow to focus, and has a slight blue tint to it. With care and deliberation you could get good shots with it, so I'd recommend taking multiple shots for everything. The battery is a mixed bag as well. It does last under load, with well over 5hrs screen on time at 50% brightness, but it drains alarmingly quickly (under 2 days with literally no use) and takes a rather long time to charge (4hrs+) regardless of the charger/cable used. Other niggles are: the power button feels rather flimsy (luckily that's remedied by the double tap screen to sleep/wake feature) and the default sound profiles don't save properly.

Now, I do have a major concern about the overall quality and longevity of this device considering that a stuck pixel developed near the center of the display only yesterday - a mere 2 weeks after purchase. This isn't a deal breaker to me considering it isn't ""dead"" - just permanently stuck on ""green"", but it does make me weary of the possible future problems. I guess I'll have to continue using it with my fingers crossed.

PROs:
-Stunning looking display
-Good battery life under load
-Long screen-on time (easily over 5hrs on 50% brightness)
-Near stock Android experience
-Nice hardware design
-Thin and light for its size
-Excellent overall value

CONs:
-Fast battery drain (less than 2 days doing absolutely nothing)
-Long charge times (4hrs+, regardless of the charger/cable used)
-Mediocre camera performance
-Weak loudspeaker, earpiece, and vibrator
-Finicky proximity sensor
-No 5GHz WiFi band support
-flimsy power button
-Display developed a stuck pixel in the first 2 weeks of use

Vs. Moto G 2015 (3rd gen)

-Looks: BLU Life One X (thinner, curved glass, metal frame, bigger/better looking display)
-Build: Moto G (chunkier, but feels more solid, less creaking, partially water proof, better mic/speaker/earpiece)
-Price: BLU Life One X (no contest; you need to pay $220 for the same internals in Moto G)
-Display: BLU Life One X (no contest; Moto G is way too blue and fuzzy, the digitizer is visible close up)
-Camera: Moto G (no contest; clearer, with better color reproduction, better autofocus, better low light performance)
-Battery: Moto G 2015 (no contest; better optimized, two heavy days of work, over a week on standby)
-Overall hardware: BLU Life One X (better display/processors, more RAM/storage, dual SIM)
-Software/features: Tie (both offer near stock experience with little to no bloatware; Moto G is better optimized, BLU has more useful customizations)
-Overall value: BLU Life One X (Moto G may be the ""safer"" choice, but it's way too underpowered/underspecced for its price)

I purchased this when it was at $99 last week and could not be happier with a phone at this price point.  Just to give you an idea, I generally use the latest phone that is out.  I have owned, the Nexus 6P, Galaxy S6, Galaxy Note 5, Galaxy Note 4, LG G4, Moto X Pure Edition, and several other high end phones.  Don't take me the wrong way, I am not comparing this phone to them but I just wanted to give an idea of what I usually use on a daily basis.

The software features alone on this phone could be something the big manufactures should look at.  You can actually schedule for the phone to turn off and turn back on for a reboot or just down time.  Also if you schedule your downtime during an alarm cycle the phone will actually power itself on for the alarm to go off and when you dismiss the alarm power itself back off!  That blew me away when this happen to me over the weekend.  You can turn on things like double tap to wake, you can draw a C on the screen to launch the camera app, and draw a O on the screen to launch the flashlight app.  All of this while the screen is off of course but great features.

For everyday use the phone handles everything I need it to do and then some.  I am not a gamer so I do not buy phones for that purpose. I generally use my phone for taking a lot of pictures, surfing the web, posting on forums, and a few other things with social media.  The phone handles the games I have tired on it with no issue.  Watching content on Plex, Netflix, and YouTube look great on the 1080P screen.  Yes I said 1080P screen for $99, that is just crazy.  Most phone in this price range come with washed out low resolution screens that are just horrible in my opinion.

The front and back camera do a good job for what the phone is. I made sure to have HDR on most of the time when taking pictures and they always came out really clear.  Dual SIM works as advertised, I had T-Mobile and Cricket running at the same time and the phone worked flawlessly with both SIMs.

I only had one issue with the phone that was not that big of a deal for me and could probably be fixed with a software update.  For some reason when I have my Samsung Gear S2 connected to the phone and I connect to my car Bluetooth at the same time for media playback.  The Bluetooth on the phone gets a little wonky and disconnects my watch.  This could be an issue with the kernel int he OS and would just take a slight tweak of it to remedy the issue.  I put in a ticket with BLU and hopefully they will address it when they push out 6.0 Marshmallow.

So to wrap up, great phone for the price.  Even at $149 it is a great phone, I have always been interested in BLU as a company and wanted to give them a try.  I don't regret the purchase one bit and have showed plenty of my co-workers and friends the phone to spread the word.","5.0 out of 5 stars"

I received it today. I have to say, this phone is pretty good. Blows my S3 out of the water. My wife has the S4 and It's pretty hard to tell a difference in speed.

It feels very quick. I don't have too much experience with it yet, but I spent the last 4+ hours playing with it.

No lag so far.
Very Sharp Picture.
Battery Life seems pretty good (I have my screen dimmed about half way). Came out of the box at around 64%. I used it for at least 4 hours and it just now got to 15%.

It's not going to rival the phones that cost as much as the rent, but it definitely is a good phone for the price. Usually when you buy a ""budget"" phone, you get what you pay for. But I'm very impressed with this one. I was nervous about the brand. Totally worth it.","5.0 out of 5 stars"

Another thing is that as other people have said the battery does take longer to charge but if you charge your phone overnight you wont have a problem.

1- the Hotspot is working in the device but when i am connecting another device with shred notwork from BLU life one X , the internet is not working on the another mobile (i have tested it to get internet connection from my Note 3 , HTC M8 but not working) this feature for me is very important and i lost it here in this device while it was awesome in my BLU VIVO air .
2- the device is terrible in recharging you can't believe more that 3.5  hours and the battery not getting full , i tried the original charger , also i tried my Anker charger (which the best chargers) , really the chrging of the device battery is too  much slow you fill that a knife is hitting you when the percentage increasing digit by digit every 7 to 8 minutes .
3- there is technical issue with the software it is restarting many times alone without pushing the power button.

Phone #1. Very fast. Speedtest around town usually around 23 Mbps, never below 20. At home 44-59. At work 14-15. Really good color quality/graphics. Not saving alarm settings, created new alarm times. Put phone on silent, but then wouldn't stay silent. Headphone jack issues- cut out completely, sound in only one earbud. Did not like the included earbuds, seemed cheap. Stopped charging correctly, went backwards. Plugged in overnight, in the morning at 48%. Thirty minutes later at 32%. Had to leave charging for almost 2 days to get 100%.

Phone #2. Much Slower and speeds varied widely. Speedtest around town and at work 3.91,10.22. About half the time would reach 20's. At home 33-48. Froze the first day I used it. Freezes up at some point every day. Headphone jack/sound issues. Second time listened to audiobook, sound was muffled and echoey. Turning up volume made echo mush worse. Impossible to listen. Saves place in audiobook sporadically.Turn phone off, sound settings go back to original when turned back on. Problems holding charge consistently.","2.0 out of 5 stars"

I bought both phones from Amazon in two different colorways black and white. My sister is currently using the white one and it works perfectly fine. But the black one was never opened until I went to Florida last week. And when trying to turn the phone on the phone keeps running the same screen saying the apps are being optimized. So I let the phone sit there for a few minutes just to make sure I wasn't going crazy. I came back about 15 to 20 minutes later and the phone was blazing hot and still wouldn't turn on. I'm using the charger that came with the phone and the phone still is on 0%. I don't know what's going on but I would like a replacement phone and I will return this one back. Though it's been some time since I ordered the phone I can reassure you that the phone was never used due to my niece misbehaving at the age of 15.

Not sure why the battery charges so slowly on my copy of this phone.  sometimes as slow as 1%/4min.  I don't expect turbo-charging and I have had other slow charging phones (Zenphone 1%/2min).  I know I can turn off the phone  or set airplane mode in order to move things along, but it really doesn't make that big of a difference with the One X.

Worth every penny and more. Have been using it for about 3 weeks now and it works very well. I am not a gamer, although my kids did install a couple of games on it (NFL and Jurassic World) and both work fine. I will mention some drawbacks but despite those, i think this is a very good phone, would definitely recommend it to my friends. It is really slim and does feel way more premium than any other phone in the $250-$450 price range. I do think it is a bit slippery though and due to the size of the screen i sometimes find myself using two hands instead of one. Camera is pretty good although it does have problems focusing on something really close by, such as the text on the back of an iphone's box. FM Radio only works with a headset, which i wasn't expecting. Speaker is a bit weak but will do the job. I plug the phone into to the aux into my car and use it to make handsfree calls and i hear some kinds of whizzing sound when i am on a call.

"","","Works great.  Best phone for the money.  I have no issues with it at all.  Battery last me all day and then some even with hard use.  I restart my phone after every charge.  It seems that background apps that run while it charges don't always turn off after you unplug the charger.  I noticed a big difference in battery time when I do this.  When I first got it, I was very concerned about why it was burning through battery so fast.  If you have this issue, try the reboot method after every charge, or check your background running apps. Monitor your ""awake time"" vs your ""screen on time"" in the battery settings chart.  They should be similar.  I noticed that my phone was almost always on (even when i wasn't using it)  which is why I was using so much battery.  I haven't identified the actual function or App that is doing this yet.  Hopefully this goes away when they finally release Marshmallow for this phone.","5.0 out of 5 stars"

I think that the screen wasn't set correctly during manufacturing and still passed quality control (assuming they have that) to eventually get to my doorstep with a defective screen.  When I first turned it on, it worked fine but after 5-10 minutes of having the screen on a white line would appear on top of the screen which would remain on every page or app on the phone (See pictures).  Aside from that defect the phone worked great.

I registered the phone with BLU and sent a warranty service request using their own website.  It's been two weeks and I still haven't heard a word from them.  From other reviews it seems BLU has a non existent customer service department.  Luckily I purchased it through Amazon and was able to return it with no hassles.

Low and behold, when I checked Amazon to return my defective White BLU Life One X they had reduced the price to $99 for one day.  So I bought the Black version and received it within two days with Prime.  This one has had no problems at all.

Both the Black and White BLU Life One X phones were fast with no bloatware.  I haven't had any battery issues with either of them.  They did discharged quickly and took a long time to charge initially but that's expected of many new batteries.  After a couple charges from 15%-10% battery charge they both charged faster and lasted longer.  A full charge on both phones lasted a full day and a half for me.  That, of course depends on how much you use it.  Initially it took about 5 hours to recharge the phone but now it takes about 3 hours to fully charge the battery from 15% charge.  It's no Motorola TurboCharge but it will do.

They both have an annoying issue with WiFi.  My WiFi, for some reason disconnect from the internet when the screen is off.  It doesn't disconnect from the WiFi itself but the internet does not work until I turn the WiFi OFF and ON again.  I checked the advanced WiFi settings and changed it to turn the WiFi off during sleep which helped with the problem.  This happened on both phones.  I don't know if it's Android 5.1 or my old WiFi antenna but it's not that big of a deal since the 4G LTE works great.  I still haven't checked with other WiFi antennas.

If you're considering buying this phone because of the accessories, DON'T.  The case is OK but like others have reported it's a bit cumbersome.  If you don't hold it right it will jump out of your hand.  The earbuds sound like the cheapest, dollar store, Chinese made junk you've ever heard.  As for the screen protector, well it doesn't fit (See Pictures).  It's at least a millimeter short on either side of the screen.  It also covers the flash and part of the sensor.  If you turn the protector the other way it also covers the camera.  I've had several smartphones during the last 10 years and I've never seen a screen protector that doesn't cover the entire screen.  This happened with both the White and Black versions.  Besides, if it has Gorilla Glass then why should it need a cheap screen protector?","3.0 out of 5 stars"

Ironically we got them at the same time, we both immediately loved them; good camera, near stock Android 5.0, great screen quality and size, made with some aluminum, expandable storage, good specs. Later I noticed a problem and asked family member if they had the same problem. They said they didn't so I t a replacement. (Problem = excessive stutters, and freezing to the point I had to reset the phone). The replacement was just fine. Two weeks later there is a small blotch of the screen that can't display dark colors. Finally decided to return for a refund. Also decided to buy the honor 5x for extra $50. Didn't like the EMUI so I sold it to a friend who wanted it. That phone was awesome: had fingerprint scanner, same size as life one X but the screen was 5.5 inches, plus full metal body! Now I was without a phone : ( . but wait Google project fi has a promo to get a Nexus 5x for $199 with activating a project fi account so now I am expecting a device that is very similar to life one X and honor 5x. Wow all the phones labled with an X ( one plus X not forgotten) any way it is a Nexus device so it is guaranteed Android M & N. May not be metal but it has a better front facing speaker, fingerprint scanner, camera is way better 4k video, and it has laser focus, has NFC So if u read this pay the extra $50 and get a nexus though it doesn't have expandable storage spend the extra $50 and get the 32gb model.

At first this phone, the BLU Life One X - 4G LTE was eating up the battery, which was consistent with many of the reviews. However, I discovered that when you swipe down from the top of the screen to reveal the menu where you turn on WIFI and Power Saving, you can also click on the ""battery"". When you click on the battery it will bring up a battery menu showing the usage, and other related features. If you click on the 3 dots in the upper right of this menu it will allow you to turn on the ""battery saver"" which changes the upper and lower bars on the screen to orange, and permits the phone to run for a very very long time. I use WIFI periodically, check my mail occasionally, surf the web on 4G LTE and WIFI, use Amazon Underground app, check the weather, text, and place and receive calls. It's now been two days since I charged my phone, and it's at 60 percent battery and telling me I have two days left on battery power. With a few power management tweaks like turning the email syncing off, turning the on screen weather app off, WIFI notifications and a few other features, I can extend the battery runtime for quite a few days. The only feature this phone doesn't have is the ability tho blacklist or block calls or messages built into the Android OS. You can add an app to do it, however; I'd prefer if BLU would add the feature like on the Vivo Air LTE and my wife's phone the BLU Pure XL 4G LTE, perhaps on the update. This phone blows my Samsung Galaxy away, especially for the price, I can get a new BLU phone every couple years if I want to, versus paying too much for the other brands. This phone does everything I want it to and more, and for $130 it's a steal.","5.0 out of 5 stars"

It was a bit difficult for me to get into the swing of things.  This was the smartest phone I'd had so far.  Also I had it a month and dropped it a very small distance.... Face down onto concrete.  The screen shattered, of course.  But also chunks of glass and the plastic underneath started chipping off.  It's still usable but highly unpleasant and sometimes I get bits of glass stuck in my thumb. It also seems to run a bit slower too.

 I'm devastated.  I don't seem to have a warranty. No returns or refunds.

I was told I could have the screen replaced at a cell phone repair shop for a reasonable price.  However I do not know if they'll be able to fix the broken plastic beneath the glass.

Also I have yet to find a case for this model other than the one that came in the package.  Which was a pleasant surprise and I enjoy very much.  But I have recently been made aware that this is not very protective of this phone's delicate parts.

Warning to all:  This phone does not have the functionality to send voice texts such as by saying ""OK Google"".  I have personally verified this with Blu technical support.  What is crazy, is that the previous generation phone (Life One), which is on my same Cricket account, can send voice text messages.  Another thing to look out for is if using this on an MVNO such as Cricket, you will have to put in an IP address such as 192.168.197.78 in place of the MMS proxy if you want picture messages to send or receive.  Again, the previous generation Life One did not have this problem.  Battery life is the final problem I have seen.  Despite a large battery, it eats through it in no time.  These problems are a shame because the phone otherwise looks great and seems to run great.  I will be sending this phone back to the amazon.  I hope this helps you make your decision on this phone.

UPDATE 4-7-2016:  After many, many hours of online research and messing with the phone, I have been able to get everything to work that I would like for the most part.  Despite BLU telling me the ""OK Google"" function wouldn't work, it does.  You have to download an app such as ""Edit Prefix Number"" to add ""+1"" before your 10 digit phone number for ALL your contacts.  This then allows the ""OK Google"" function to text or call your contacts.  That is fixed.  As for the MMS (picture messages), I have Cricket, so I put in the following into the APN:
Name:  Internet
APN: ndo
APN:  default, mms, supl
MMSC: [...]
MMS Proxy:  192.168.197.78
MMS port: 80
MCC:  310
MNC:  150
ENSURE YOU ONLY EDIT THE EXISTING OR FIRST APN since adding additional will not work. Notice the IP address for the proxy in place of the proxy.aiowirelss entry.  This seems to work so just go with it.  The battery has seemed to get better by turning off an number of the notifications such as gmail and facebook.  It seems to last through the day now.  There is a new issue with phone calls getting cut off in the middle of the call.  I believe this occurs with use of the ""Smart Awake"" and or ""Smart Gesture"" functions under settings. I haven't narrowed it down to one or the other, but with them both off, the calls are not being cut off.  They both have a double click function to lock and unlock the screen.  I believe if you face touches the screen twice in a row close together, it hangs up the phone call.  While the double click to unlock is a nice feature (like what the LG phones have), it is worth it to not have every phone call hang up.  For $100, and with the above issues resolved, this really is a great phone!  I really like the folding cover that comes with the phone.  it had a magnet in it, that lock and unlocks the phone when you open or close it, like an IPad.  Another thing to note, this phone does not have a gyro sensor, so some pedometer apps, among others, will not work.  Not sure why they left out something that costs about 10 cents.  I now recommend this product.","4.0 out of 5 stars"

Amazing phone for the price. I was able to get it for $100 USD since I bought it in the first 3 days of release. Performs very well and comes with a screen protector and a case. The value is amazing for what you get (even if you purchase at $150).

I highly recommend this phone - it's actually great as a basic daily driver. My Z3 compact finally died just a few days after it arrived and it served as my daily driver until I switched to the S7 edge...my only motivation for switching over was due to the better camera and battery life (which wasn't even that big of a jump over the BLU). I was able to root it quickly and put on xposed without much problems.

The only problem I faced was that I got some hairline scratches (probably due to daily use) on the top corner after a few weeks of use.
This was due to my laziness to put on (the free included) screen protector and that I was not careful with the phone at all during that time. Due to my shallow pockets, the top corner was often exposed and I probably scratched on something a while back. I struggle to even call this an issue since it was all due to my carelessness and laziness.","4.0 out of 5 stars"

Looks: The white piece looks like a cheap chineese mobile. May be the black one is a better choice. I regret for choosing a white one.
Display: Is superb. Very Bright.
Touch: Is not great. I was using LG mobile which has feather touch sensitivity. So I feel a great difference. That's okay for a budget mobile.
Performance: Is just average and definitely will become slow over a period of time.
Battery: Is taking 4hrs  to charge and will last  more than day on a moderate usage.
Connectivity: I am using AT&T goPhone SIM and is Easy to register on the mobile. Just insert the sim and you are all set. I am getting 3 bars signal in my area. Video streaming is fast over 4G. Call quality is good.
Camera: Picture quality is noisy and video is very shaky. This mobile is not for those who loves to take pictures and videos.
Audio: Speaker is not loud but In ear phone sound is very loud and clear.
Accessories: Cheap ear phones, screen protector and cover case. Better not to use them.

As for speed it is decent, I have been using the galaxy note series since the very first galaxy note 1 and comparing this phone to those I would say it has a 5-10 seconds lag compared to the galaxy note 3, still its a decent speed considering that this phone cost $150 (or $100 if you got it on sale like me) compared to $700 which is what I paid for my galaxy note 3 when it first came out. I would give it 8 stars for overall value if I could, can't bet this quality at this price ( my opinions on this product are mostly for those who use smart phones for calling, social media/net browsing and entertainment (netflix,Hulu,YouTube etc) best money I have spent in a while","5.0 out of 5 stars"

First, the speakers are not as bad as some reviews say. True it can get muffled at full volume but they can get pretty loud and clear of you don't max it out. Second, the screen quality is above average and better, in fact, than most phones priced at this range. Lastly, the battery, sad to say, is disappointing. Hence the 3 stars. The 2900 mAh battery does not live up to expectations. I have a blu advance and a samsung galaxy s5 (but with smaller batt capacity) and they last longer than the blu life one X. With the wifi and gps on the entire time and while surfing the net, I noticed that the batt would last only about 6 to 8 hours. Nothing like what the description says. I always have to carry a battery bank with me because I don't know when this phone will die, especially if i have to be on the field the entire day. Don't get me wrong, I would still buy this phone at the 150 price range. I just wished they improved the capacity of the batt.","3.0 out of 5 stars"

But after 3 months of using this phone, I can honestly say I would not purchase this or any other BLU phone again.

The one star I gave this phone is for the nice display that it has. But everything else about this phone sux.

Below are details on just a few of the important features and how badly they are dysfunctional.

Camera:
BLU calls this camera a 13mp, but no way is that accurate. My last BLU phone had an 8mp camera and it was much better, and less grainy. Heck, I have taken better quality pix with my Polaroid 3.2mp digi cam 7 years ago. Picture details: after numetous tries and various settings, the picture quality is poor. When taking indoor daytime pix with this phone's camera, the images were very dark, even with a combo of incandescent lighting plus camera flash, plus natural lighting from windows. When I took pix of my crafts for my blog, I tried in a very well-lit place with studio lighting (no flash was used), yet the pictures always looked slightly out of focus, like they have a weird, hazy filter over them. Outdoor pix in natural lighting also appear to have the same hazy filter. Changing the settings within the camera's app did not change the haze nor the clarity. I am not a novice when it comes to knowing how to take high-quality digital pictures, so this result isn't due to user error. The bottom line is, this phone's camera is a very poor quality camera.

Battery:
The phone's battery is extremely SLOW to charge, so much so that it actually discharges even while it is plugged in charging. Just reading a blog post online while it is plugged in will cause the phone to reset if the battery level falls below 15%. Yeah, it's that slow to charge. And no, it isn't because there are too many apps running. I have minimal apps downloaded and I keep them all turned off. The only way to keep the phone from dying while charging it is to put it in airplane mode and not use it at all while it is plugged in for several hours, which is unacceptable battery performance, in my opinion.

OS:
This phone has an updated OS, being the BLU version of Android 5.1 Lollipop. While Lollipop is an improvement over the previous Android OS, BLU's version is very clunky. One major gripe of mine is how BLU disabled the menu button on the home-screen, and instead has assigned that button's function to be Recent Activity. This is a huge problem for me because I can no longer interact with apps in the same way that I could with previous phones. For one example, when using the Facebook app, pressing a phone's menu button on all of my previous Android phones would bring up the option to report an app bug, with a default screenshot of the exact operation that was being reported, plus the option for me to share one additional screenshot for a total of two photos. This is not possible with BLU's version of Lollipop because the menu button is disabled. Now to report a FB app bug, I must go to my Facebook drop-down menu on my profile and click the report option. The default screenshot of the trouble spot is not included in that option. It might not matter to most people to lose the use of the menu button, but for me being a Facebook group owner, this is a big deal. There are a few more issues with this phone's OS besides the disabled menu function. BLU's OS is riddled with random keyboard freezes, as well as random shut-downs even when the battery is fully charged.

In summary, I am very regretful that I chose this phone. I would not recommend it for anyone who needs dependability from their phone or phone's camera.

The bottom line is, it is an unreliable device, not worth the cost of shipping.","1.0 out of 5 stars"

In most respects, it performs as well as my Nexus 5.  There is one glaring exception that keeps me from giving it 5 stars: The screen touch sensitivity is occasionally lacking.  This shows up sporadically when playing games, typing swype-style, and entering patterns into the pattern lock.

I should also note that the camera's image quality is probably a step down from the Nexus, though the camera itself is fast and easy to use.  It is fine for snapshots and selfies, but I will probably never be blown away by the quality of any of its images.  Nor would I expect that at this price.

I continue to be blown away by this device's overall performance, and recommend it over most inexpensive phones and even as an alternative to most mid-priced phones.","4.0 out of 5 stars"

It's nice that it comes with a case and screen cover as I like to keep my phones at least 2 years.  The set up was easy once you insert your sim card in.  I'm not sure if my memory card is in right though.
The call quality has been excellant, the speaker is a little low though.  The only thing that is disappointing is the camera.  For that many megapixels the photos seem to come out ""milky"".

*BUILD QUALITY*
- A decently build phone. Back panel creaks a little bit but I don't notice with a case on.
- Upgradeable memory. I stuck a 64 gig microSD card and won't have to worry about filling up for a long time to come.
- Overall a sleek looking phone that doesn't look the price.
- 5/5

*USER INTERFACE*
- Nearly stock android. A few alterations such as lock screen gestures and a ""clear all"" button on the multitasking screen.
- Replaced stock launcher with Nova launcher for more customization.
- No bloatware, or at least so minimal that I did not notice it once if I hid them from the app drawer using Nova Launcher.
- Overall rating: 5/5

*RESPONSIVENESS*
- Microlags when multitasking heavily. Not enough to bog down daily experience.
- Some games do not run at full 60 FPS but over very pleased. Have a DS and GBA emulator along with Clash Royale, all running well. I assume heavier games would not.
- Keyboard rarely skips but that is often after being in my pocket for a while and sweat/oil may have accumulated. Swipe works decently.
- Overall rating: 4/5

*BATTERY LIFE*
- A mixed bag in this category. My lumia 640 would last me upwards of 3 days with minimal use, and 1.5 days easily with moderate to heavy use.
- This phone scrapes to the end of the day with 10-20%, if not dead. This runs from 9am to 11PM.
- Usage includes web browsing, youtube, checking clash royale, email autosynced, messenger force shut down in the background, occasional listening to music.
- Screen on time can be 3-4.5 hours on a good day.
- The biggest flaw to this phone is its charging time. You better charge this at night or else you'll be dead all the next day. May take up to 4.5 hours with the included charger and power brick, and even longer with USB charging through a computer or different charger/powerbrick combo.
- Signal seeking is not the strongest for this phone, so I assume it uses up extra battery trying to hold onto that signal. Turn off data if you don't need it.
- Overall rating: 3/5

*CAMERA*
- Lumia 640 had a much better camera, but that is expected as all nokia phones have very good sensors and the bundled Lumia Camera app offers amazing manual controls.
- Default app is sufficient for daytime photos. Sometimes blurry if you don't hold your hand steady.
- Indoor/macro shots are poor. Lots of artifacting and does not pick up light well.
- Video is good. No complaints here.
- Front facing camera has a flash. Bonus points here. Also has a ""wide angle"" selfie panorama which has come in handy.
- For the price of $99, a good camera overall.
- Overall rating: 4.5/5

*ACCESSORIES*
- Not many accessories for this phone. Best luck for a screen protector and case was on ebay searching for ""Wiko fever 4g case"" as it is the same model just different branding.
- Overall accessory support: 3/5

*FINAL THOUGHTS*
- As my first android phone I am more than pleased. While it lacks in super fast speeds and an amazing camera, I got it for $99. Subjectively, you cannot beat that price with other phones on the market for now. A big question you have to ask yourself when buying a phone is: what will you use it for? I simply text, call, take a few photos, browse the web, watch youtube, play a few apps. Does a $300+ smartphone to accomplish that? Yep. Does this phone accomplish the same but for a third of the price? Yep.

Final rating: 4/5","4.0 out of 5 stars"

I had researched the best unlocked phones for under $200 and this one got rave reviews.  So I decided to buy it.  I actually ordered it through an Amazon Warehouse Deal.  I've had Samsung, and Blu is at least better than an S5, which is saying a lot, because I loved mine before I dropped it down the steps.  The design is beautiful and sleek.  And you know you are holding quality.  Everything feels solid and well put together.  The processor is rock solid, the screen is fantastic, and everything runs smooth.  The flip case is not something I thought I would use until I saw it.  It essentially replaces the original back panel on the phone.  I think it's great.

Only negative:  It charges at a glacial pace, and if you are really setting the phone to perform in the options, the battery doesn't last as long as other phones I've used.  However, it is not even close to being a deal breaker.

The next step up from this phone in the Blu line is the Vivo 5.  It's metal, it looks amazing, but the display is only 720, since they had to shave costs somewhere to build an all metal phone.  I could have bought either, and I bought the Life One X.  I haven't regretted it for a second.","5.0 out of 5 stars"

It has enough RAM (2GB) to keep from swapping under heavy use (something the Moto G had a real problem with, given its complement of only 1GB RAM), a fast 8 core CPU, a stunning full HD screen, and absolutely minimal bloatware along with being thin and lightweight. Minor downsides include lack of 5GHz band wi-fi and NFC. Big deal. Power consumption, once I downloaded and installed a recent update, is shockingly minimal. This device sets the bar for price/performance. No reason at all to buy a phone through your cellular service provider - get this instead and save yourself $$$.","5.0 out of 5 stars"

Huge screen, amazing resolution and colors. Feels heavy for it's size which I like. For $150 you get a well built phone with up to date technology, a case, charger, screen protector and headphones. Yes, the screen protector is a bit narrow for the phone, but it's really not needed unless you're really rough with your phone. If anyone is looking for a phone that looks and feels like the iPhone, without being financially violated, this is the phone to get.

Update: 3/1/16 This is by far the best phone I've ever had, though I do have a few complaints. The first was the issue with MMS messages. We set up our phones with Cricket and after spending over 30 minutes on the phone with them, the only resolution to the problem was to use Google Hangouts to send and receive MMS texts. The second problem is that setting a custom ringtone does not work. I've searched online through forums and tried every suggestion and it still defaults to the factory ringtone, despite all settings correctly set. Lastly, I ordered the white one for myself and the back gets very dirty and it's impossible to clean. I tried Clorox wipes and Magic Erasers and neither worked. I ended up switching to the folio case it came with just so it doesn't look gross. These are minor issues since the phone functions perfectly well. I just wanted to share my experience so others are aware.","5.0 out of 5 stars"

If you're looking at this phone, save yourself and go look at better phones not made by this company. (That is if you consider Blu doesn't even actually manufacture them.)

Here are the things I like about this phone:
1. Excellent 5"" screen. Very sharp with rich colors. I enjoy reading on this phone.
2. Battery life is very good. I will often have around 30% battery life at the end of the day even though I am a heavy phone user.
3. Adding this unlocked phone to my AT&T account was painless. Reception, internet and wifi are very good on this phone, equal to my AT&T phone.
4. The price. Can't argue that you get a decent phone for the money. Plus if you are a fan of unlocked phones, this is even better for you.

The camera is an in-between item. It's not bad but tends to take blurry pictures if you aren't carefully still. Perhaps it lacks image stabilization?

Cons for this phone:
1. ""Dead"" spots. Often I have a small area on the phone, about the size of a fingertip, that will not respond to touch. Imagine you are playing solitaire and the card in the corner cannot be moved. This usually clears up if I restart the phone but eventually comes back. Often a picture from Facebook messenger appears on my screen, as it does to indicate a message from that person. Only there is no new message and that picture will not go away. This is extremely frustrating even though it doesn't seriously change the functionality of the phone.
2. Cases. I'm not crazy about the case that came with the phone and there really aren't any other options out there. Perhaps there will be more when this model has been around longer. Who knows? Not me.

Is this a good phone? It depends on what you are looking for. I'd say it's not an exciting, top of the line phone but it is a reliable, functional phone that won't exhaust your budget too much if you are looking for an unlocked smart phone with a large screen.","3.0 out of 5 stars"

I won't be able to break down specs, etc. I've only used Android phones. The last I really liked was my GALAXY S 5. I did not want to pay that kind of price for a phone again this soon the way technology just constantly offers us new items. So when my daughter bought one of these and told me the specs were comparable enough to the S5 I loved I decided for the price to try it.

There, of course, are differences. The battery charges quite a bit slower. There is lag occasionally but very occasionally. Overall, I like this phone. The only other issue I've had has been calls disconnecting due to that sensor at the top of the phone, the face proximity thing. Apparently, it's not perfect. But it does work pretty well.

I don't use the screen protector. I've always been a Zagg fan and last I looked couldn't find one. These are not good. But to get a phone, case, and protector for the price is unheard of.

Only regret is that I didn't buy it during the $100 promotion (I was skeptical and waiting for more reviews). I was on the fence because I am a high end phone user. I'm ""upgrading"" from my LG G3 and I honestly like this phone more than the G3. The G3 BURNED through battery so quickly that I didn't even get half a day's worth in most cases. This battery seems to be much better but does take a long while to charge (about 3 hours in my case to charge from 25% to full). So far, I've gotten almost 5 hours of screen on time, which is awesome (the G3 would give me 2 at most)! The processor is also wonderful! Its much better than the Octa Core Qualcomm 610 that came with the Onetouch Idol 3 (which was a great phone but always micro lagged due to a low powered 1.0 GHz cores). I am selling both my G3 and my Alcatel Idol 3 because I love this phone! Some things I don't like is the fact that it doesn't have 5GHz internet. My apartment complex is overflowing with 2.4GHz congestion and I like to say in the 5GHz bands if possible, but it's not a big deal for me. I found out that using the given charger charges a little bit faster than the QuickCharge 2.0 charger I have from Aukey (which I find odd). The leather-like case is also pretty great. Almost feels like leather! I PUT A 64GB MicroSD card in the phone and it works well (make sure you format it first on the computer to a FAT32 format, else it won't work). I moved most of my apps on the MicroSD card and after installing about 100 APPS, I still have 6GB of free internal space available! Even with 100 apps installed, the battery seems to keep up well throughout the day. I get LTE with Cricket and MMS works after getting the right MMS APN from the internet.

I also think the build quality and overall feel of this phone is amazing. Compared to my LG G3, it's much lighter and narrower, which means I can easily get a good grip. The curved edges and the aluminum body is premium looking and feels great in the hands. The Gorilla Glass 3 also provides great touch experience because it's very smooth. The best thing I like about this phone is the price, I spent only $20 to get this phone because I had Amazon gift cards. Because it's so inexpensive, I can basically throw it away if it breaks by falling, so this will be my first phone that I won't be buying a better case for!

Update: 1/23/16
Ive been using this phone for about two weeks now. I still like it a lot. I installed about 150 apps and games and there's still 4.3 GB of space left on the Internal space (I'm also using a memory card and have moved most of my apps over to it). Battery life is great. I get about 4.5 hours on a single charge. Battery takes about 3 hours to recharge from 20% to 100%, which is fine for me. No slowdowns whatsoever. Overall, just loving this phone. And have finally decided to sell the G3 and Alcatel Onetouch Idol 3 because this phone will be my daily driver for the next 5 months at least!","5.0 out of 5 stars"

Nothing comes close, not even for $100 more.  NOTE: contrary to several sites, there is NO gyroscope with this phone.

It's often compared to the Moto G 3rd Gen, which I used to own, yet has double the RAM, double the storage, faster processor and a 1080p display versus the Moto's 720p.  The BLU is generally the prettier phone, and it's thinner, if that matters to you, but neither are chunky.  It should be noted that despite superior specs, I've so far seen no difference in speed or performance with basic browsing, music, and mobile games, but the BLU may really shine with the next release of AndroidOS.

The Moto G 3rd Gen has a few features that the BLU doesn't, such as water-proofing and tons more case options. If you're accident-prone, these are worthwhile features. The Moto also has a better, louder speaker.  This is especially noticeable in the car using it as a GPS.  Battery life is also superior in the Moto: I routinely got 3 solid days on the Moto to the Blu's 1.5 - 2.

Another difference is software and hardware refinement.  The Blu has some serious annoyances. It often starts an app rather than swipes (too sensitive). It took several attempts to connect to my home wifi (but once connected seems stable).  It often switches to speaker phone from my ear touching the screen (very annoying).  Sometimes it gets warm in my pocket and I pull it out to find the flashlight has somehow turned on.  Other times it goes into airplane mode on its own.  Google voice commands only work if I speak toward the bottom of the phone and I have to speak especially loudly.  This makes voice commands especially awkward and limited.  On long drives I like to voice-command reading and replying to text messages and it went from passable on the Moto to painful on the Blu.  Basically what's kind of a cool experience/tool degrades to a kind of ""nerd shouting at his phone"" sort of thing.

Lastly, GPS reception is noticeably poorer than the Moto. I thought I had a bad phone at first, as while sitting at my desk it didn't work at all, but it started working when I went outside. I think BLU assumes people are using the combined GPS and Network locationing, yet most of the time, particularly when walking, I use GPS only to save battery.  Or I like to set up my directions before I leave the house/office rather than fuss in the car.  The weaker GPS in the BLU makes this a more frustrating experience.

In the end, if you're willing to trade some rough edges for some very impressive features and specs found only on much more expensive phones, this is a great choice.  If you want a more refined, smooth, ""just works"" experience and are willing to pay a small premium for it, the Moto is better.","4.0 out of 5 stars"

Amazing phone,  u can't go wrong at this price (Jan 2016 Review Comment)
I never wrote any reviews before, but could not stop writing for this one,  I was initially  hesitant to go for a brand that at least I wasn't aware about however given the price and specs I thought of buying it. My first impression after getting it - amazing...wow.  this is no where close to any cheap phone rather comparison can be done with any high end phones in the price bracket of $300-400. I got this in $99 but $149 is also a deal price only.

May 2016 Review now -> with 1 Star Rating
When I first wrote 5 months back,  about this phone, I was super excited and happy about this phone. I was feeling lucky to get this specs in $100 and not so cheap quality like another china phone however now my WOW factor started to go away to every day frustration on this phone & company customer care. customer care division is just pathetic and despite making every attempt to talk or write them, final outcome is always ZERO.

Issues that I have ->
Battery won't last for more than couple of hours with just regular use. I  keep my 4G ON but do not do any facebook or much internet browsing. My entire day of browsing usage not more than 30 mins and video NONE or camera NONE.
My main use of the phone making call or answer phone (not more than 60 mins per day)
Battery will drain as if there is some hole and won't charge quickly too. with every week going by, I see charging time gradually increasing from 1-2 hours to almost 6-7 hours and many times, in just 1-2 hours it won't charge at all. It is so frustrating.

I am kind of at a stage to throw this phone now and buy a new one for myself.
Keeping frustrating battery & charging issue aside, otherwise phone responds okay.","1.0 out of 5 stars"

However, the build is quite shoddy. The cover doesn't fit quite right and the power button just fell off. I've had the phone for a little under 3 months and have treated it very well. No knocks, no drops, nothing. So while it looks slick and works well, I'd keep in mind that it IS a budget phone and after only 3 months, it's starting to show. I have to say I'm disappointed. It was a shock to take it out of my pocket to change my music only to find that the power button was no longer there. I'll be damned if I know where it went.

Don't think you have to spend $300 - $700 just to have a state of the art smart phone. This has all the capability of the more expensive brand name phones, but for only a few bucks, comparably.
One thing you might want to consider with this phone though; It has a ton of options and settings. A dream for any Millennial, but I'm sure a nightmare for anyone with a less than friendly relationship with technology.
Another con; Right now, there are few phone case options. But I hope that will change as more people buy this phone.
And the final negative; It does take about 6 hours to charge from empty. But you can greatly extend the daily life of your battery by installing the Clean Sweep app, and using the tools tab to extent battery life by hrs. Then just charge over night while you sleep.
But those are easy things to ignore, especially when your phone is as awesome as this phone!

I have the previous version of this device (blu life one LTE 4G 2015) based on this device will make contributions:
I will highlight the most important things, starting with the physical section: compared to the previous version of black color, which is very sensitive to its material, this device has excellent construction despite its back is plastic (which assimilates the leather).
Screen: The screen of the previous device looked very good, but this is excellent, all very crisp very realistic color and other (light considering the price of the device).
Light on the front camera: very rare, but it works very well.
More storage space, more RAM, 2 SIM + Micro SD. There are many new things including this device, very tempting price, and at a bid of $ 99.
But nothing is perfect.
Compared to the previous device:
The battery is horrible: I can not believe it but charge this device at 100% and just do some activities and is 90-85% when playing the battery fades.
Another thing I can not accept is the speaker, it is not heard, you can have it with you, if you get a notice not you realize, if you have it in the bag can only know that they call by vibration, this is bad as I've seen.
additional:
Other things are: its scabbard (very nice but does not work very well), actions like double tap for unlocking the phone in your bag is unlocked there and do a lot of things alone.

- Dual GSM Sim / Dual Standby
- Ram is 2GB, big improvement among CHEAP BLU phones
- Light weight, bright screen, full-HD 1080p
- microSD card slot

So so OK:
- Battery: no quick charge, even with 2Amp charger. Acceptable.
- Camera: high MP does not mean high quality. Photo is OK, not great
- Low volume loud speaker, but can be fixed.

Cons / bad:
- The Worst in customer service.
- Slow speed (that how MTK6753, even 8 cores)
- Non-removable battery.
- Touch screen still bad

*** Overall: for initial sale $99 / currently $150, the phone is OK. For this price, consider Zenfone 2 laser which is way much better in term of performance. If you want to play around with this fone, visit my thread @xda forum

I've been using it over three weeks now and will be returning it today.

I'll start with the positives:
-The 1080p display is good for this price point. It's not near flagship level and colors look somewhat dull, even on the ""vivid"" mode, but for a ""pharmacy phone"" it's very good.
-The phone has good specs for this price point
-The phone is thin and light

Now the negative:
-Battery life is actually horrible. One of the things that sold me on this phone was the professional reviews (e.g. Android Authority) that said battery life was great. Immediately after disconnecting from the charger (after being plugged in for 12 hours), the battery level instantly fell to 98%. I cleared the few running applications and left the phone sitting 10 minutes in idle mode with the screen off and checked the battery level again. It had dropped to 90%! Expect to the battery level to drop 1% for every minute the screen is on.
-The speaker is very poor compared to my 2014 Moto G and understanding someone using the speakerphone function is impossible.
-This phone cannot receive MMS (multimedia, pictures) via text! I tried both the built in Android and Google hangouts. I supposed there probably is a fix for this and I did calling BLU customer support, but their office was closed when I called at 3 pm PST on a weekday.
-The phone feels fragile, like it could bend or snap very easily if you applied moderate force or sat on it accidentally
-I experienced occasional lags and freeze-ups when multitasking.

This Blu Life One X is a great phone. I have had it for several weeks now. I can not believe the difference between the two.

I read all the reviews before I purchased it. Most complaints were the battery life, speaker phone and issues with Cricket wireless APN settings. Soon after I bought my phone, I received an update which took care of the battery issues. I also adjusted the screen setting downward (too bright), turned on the battery saver mode. Huge difference! The battery will last me all day and I am a heavy user. I also use this phone as a wireless hot spot since I live in a cornfield.

I changed Crickets APN settings, which do not work with some Blu phones, so I could get the MMS messages to work incoming and outgoing. First thing I did was chat with Cricket and had them push settings to the phone (didn't work). I then changed the default APN settings. You can change it back to default settings if you messed up or it didn't work.

To get to the APN settings I went to ""settings"",  clicked the ""more"" button,  clicked the ""cellular networks"", clicked ""Access Point Names"", then pressed ""internet"". I changed the settings to the following:

Name: internet
APN: ndo
APN type: default, MMS, supl
Port: not set
Username: not set
Password: not set
Server: not set
MMSC: [...]
MMS Proxy: proxy.aiowireless.net
MMS port: 80
MCC: 310
MNC: 150

Leave everything else un-touched. Make sure you save your changes before you leave the page.

As for the speaker phone I have no issues. I use it for all my calls. It sounds loud and clear and I come across the same way.

The photos come out beautiful. The camera is a little different then the one in the Studio 5.5S. On the Life One X you aim at something,  tap the screen to focus directly on what you want.  A green box will appear and the camera is focused. You won't be disappointed. There are several settings for your camera. I haven't tried those as I am a point and shoot girl. There is a flash for the front and back cameras. Oh,  don't forget to remove the protective film on the back camera.

I have streamed Amazon videos without any problems. They are bright and smooth. I also have watched movies from my micro SDHC UHS card with no issues.

I would highly recommended this phone based on price, the 2gb ram, the 16gb storage, the Gorilla Glass 3 screen, 1080p, etc. There is a lot of power in this thin nice looking phone.

Hopefully Blu will keep their promise of a Marshmallow update during the first quarter of this year.","5.0 out of 5 stars"

I decided to care a little more about my money so this year to replace my Nexus 5 I did the research and went with the BLU Life One X 2016.
The design is flawless, I love how thin it is and the screen is really bright and good quality. The build quality has a premium feel, and the button layout is perfect, feeling great in the hand. After watching a few reviews the battery life was a concern but if you know android you know how to fix that which I did. Before the tweaks I got 9 hours and that's with Netflix, FB, IG, YouTube, Maps and about 400 text and a few calls..  The phone in a way reminds me of my Nexus 5, there isn't much of a learning curb as the UI is basically stock. When it comes to speed the phone is fast and can get even faster!!! Gaming is smooth and as well as browsing and Netflix looks great . The camera is better than expected, you can get some really great pics or really bad ones. Radio wise again this phone flies, and yes you do get T Mobiles band12 where its available. I have it in my area and it is consistently full bar LTE.... There is no NFC or Finger print Scanner but truthfully who really needs it? The only cons I truly have is that speaker is has little to no bass but the volume is definitely loud enough. Also I'm not a fan of flip cases even though the one packed with this phone is well done, wish there were more options.. This phone will be my daily driver for some time, I originally was going to grab the Honor 5X however my Nexus 5 decided for me by dying.. If BLU stays true to their word and update the Life One X to Android 6.0 it'll only get better...  Honestly this phone is a hidden jem for its price point, BLU has done a great job...","5.0 out of 5 stars"

My experience doesn't seem to jive with the rest of the reviews here but it's just what I experienced so take it as you may.

- Battery life was absolutely horrible. I tend to use my phone quite heavily and I have a lot of apps so I understand that I'm not going to be getting primo battery life.  That was never a problem until I used this phone.  In comparison I previously had an LG G2.  With the same apps and same style of use, my battery lasted me easily twice as long even a year after using the phone.  Maybe I got a bad one, I don't know but there's no reason that my phone would be down 5% batter 5 minutes after unplugging it. It was crazy!  In about 3 hours unplugged I'd be down to about 75% battery left. Regardless of phone age or apps running I've never experienced that kind of battery drain with any other phone.

- Charging was terrible. Again I don't know if I somehow got a bum phone but based on the other reviews here I'd guess not. I plugged this phone into my previous chargers phone charger, it stayed plugged in over night.  The next morning it had gained about 13% in charge.  When plugged in with the charger that came with the phone, it charged fully overnight.  I don't pretend to understand these things but I can't figure out what the difference is, it was super annoying though. I don't want to buy several of these proprietary chargers just to be able to charge at various locations, and frankly even if I did, the phone charges so slowly (even ON the proprietary charger) that it wouldn't really get me much.  I like to ""top off"" before I head out for a night sometimes, that was not an option here.

- Lag. I know this is crazy with the specs on the phone but anytime I had google navigation and spotify going at the same time, spotify just stuttered horribly.  I also periodically experienced keyboard typing delay.

- Reliability.  There was twice in a two week period that my morning alarm just plain never went off.  Why? Unsolved mystery.  I double checked all the settings, didn't change anything, and the next day it went off just fine.  No idea what that's about but yeah.

- The speaker is crappy and on the back of the phone.  It's super quiet to begin with but on top of that it's located on the back of the phone so if you leave your phone face up you pretty much aren't hearing anything.

So I sent this phone back and got a moto g 3rd gen, which is working out much better.","2.0 out of 5 stars"

She loves the Apple phones, but we didn't want to spend 600+ on a brand new phone, and we needed it in a pinch.

The phone is very nice for the price.

It does feel a bit cheap with the back plastic case, and when you hold it there is some 'give' when you squeeze the case. Not a big deal, as we don't usually squeeze our phones much ;) The white does look dirty quickly, and is hard to clean because of the pebbling/leather grain look.

The camera is ok, but I think worse than the 4s's camera, which is sad. No stability control, etc, so you have to have a steady hand to get good photos.

The screen is great, nice and sharp, and responds to touch perfectly.

Aftermarket cases are hard to come by, but it did come with one (which my wife didn't like). We are still hunting for an alternative.

I'd buy the phone again. If you are on a budget, you can't go wrong.","4.0 out of 5 stars"

That means full featured, not cheap, dumbed down and/or bullt with low spec parts.

Pros: Lots of memory and accepts SD cards for even more.  Decent camera even indoors.  Not TOO much bloatware but some.  A few preloaded apps are only preloaded (not ""installed"") and can be deleted, rather than just deactivated.  Package is complete; a VERY nice integrated leatherette cover (replaces the rear cover), plastic screen shield, charger and cable are included.  You don't need to spend another nickle unless you don't have an SD card on hand.

Cons:  not a big fan of the BLU launcher app, and haven't had much luck so far in trying to turn it off completely and load another, but have only tried once.  Battery isn't replaceable.

For the money, the specs are great, performance is solid.  I recommend this for anyone that wants a full featured android phone with enough horsepower and screen resolution to play in the same league as the high end phones without requiring a second mortgage.

As with all tech, and cells especially, this review is only true for the next 20 minutes.  However right now, if you want to keep price low, keep all the key features of Android, have decent cameras and reasonable performance, you have to put this one on your short list.","5.0 out of 5 stars"

There was some PR copied by PC magazine about Android 6 for this device, that it would be released for this phone first quarter of 2016, and that was the deciding factor on getting this phone.  There is no update, and I contacted BLU directly, and they acknowledged that there is no update.  They did not comment on if there would be and when even when I asked -- just ignored the question.  I am NOT happy about that.

I picked up two of these, for my wife and I for 100 bucks each.

Interface is satisfactorily minimalist -- no extra app stores or apps to kill.

Google's restore process worked great -- migrated all my apps to my new phone.... sadly, better than I wanted.  It migrated all the apps I couldn't remove from my S3 (preinstalled Samsung apps :)  ).  Got them removed though.

I don't understand the complaint about charging time.  I charge my phone completely in 3-4 hours easy.  To be fair though, I still haven't used the included chargers.  I previously bought the 60 Anear 6-port charger and have had great luck with everything I'm plugging in:

http://www.amazon.com/Desktop-Charging-PowerSmart-Technology-Compatible/dp/B011LSGMT2?ie=UTF8&psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o02_s00

As for handling.  It feels much better in my large hands than the S3, but the finish on the back is so slick, I can't rest it on my clothes at all without it sliding off.

Camera takes excellent photos.

Phone is darn snappy -- battery life is adequate, though I am coming off a double-sized battery for my old S3, so it is reduced.  Still it has been lasting all day, and I recently bought the 10,000 mAh USB charger from KMASHI, and it can charge this thing multiple times, and as fast as my wall charger, so I just keep it in the car with me.

Bottom line: Give me an Android 6 update, and I will be ecstatic.

Update 4-8-16

I use a bluetooth headset while at the gym.  The range on the bluetooth is decidedly less than my Galaxy S3.  I could walk half-way across the gym (one big open room, about 200 ft long total) before the audio would cut out.  Now I get about 20 feet away before it starts stuttering.  That may or may not be a good thing.  Sometimes I'd move on to the next machine without noticing I forgot my phone.  :)","4.0 out of 5 stars"

This thing runs like a CHAMP.  There is barely any bloatware on it, and what there is, I've been able to disable/remove without issue.

I play games on it at work for a solid 8-10 hours (I ""work"" 12), and it has only ever died on me once.  Screen looks great, and the optional flip cover it came with is really nice; it works great with android, going so far as to show my media player and weather at a glance.
The Bad:
After the update a few days ago, it charges for 2-3% and stops completely.  It also randomly shuts itself off as of the last update.
The Ugly?:
I can't say for sure if this is an issue with the update itself, or if the phone has already started to die.  I know other people have had this issue.  I'm going to try and reset the phone to see if it improves, because I REALLY want to keep this phone. It runs entirely too well for it's price point.

"","","Initial Review 5/27/2016

So far I've had this phone for going on three days.  I'll write my initial impressions here and then update this review in a month or so to give a longer term impression.

I got this phone to replace an Amazon Fire Phone I was using on the T-Mobile network.  The phone had all of the features I was looking for in a phone, unlocked LTE, 2gb of RAM, 16GB internal storage with an SD slot, 1080p display and it was all relatively inexpensive.

Two problems I have noticed right off the bat are, inability to use alternate .mp3 ringtones for individual contacts, and even with SD card being selected for primary storage, downloaded apps get installed on the phone storage and have to be manually moved to the SD card.

The phone itself is very nice in my opinion, the display is very clear with nice bright colors, very easy to view outdoors.  I don't have the best eyes and I only have the brightness turned up to 50% or so in the direct sunlight.  The display registers input okay, not quite as reliable as the Fire Phone, there have been a couple occasions already where a tap has not registered, but it's nothing too bothersome so far and it could just be me fat fingering things.

The sound from the single rear speaker isn't the greatest but for me it isn't really a problem.  The only sound I usually have on is the ringer, the app volume is usually off on my phone and I can still hear the ringer clearly with this speaker.  Compared to the Fire Phone the volume and audio quality are lesser from the Life One X.

The overall feel of the phone is nice.  The Life One X is wider and taller than the Fire Phone, but thinner.  It doesn't feel as heavy or substantial as the Fire Phone, but it doesn't feel too light or cheap either.  The back of the phone has a nice textured ""leather"" finish which makes gripping it easier.  The bevel and surround metal feel high quality as well.  I personally dislike larger smartphones, I thought  my Fire Phone was a perfect size and I was having trouble finding a new phone that wasn't, in my opinion, too big.  The Life One X is a good size, it fits nicely in my hand and works great with single handed operations.

Operation of apps is relatively smooth, some apps seem to take a second or two longer to start initially than my Fire Phone did, but once they are running, switching between apps and running them is smooth.  To be honest I don't really play a lot of games, my kids do that more than I do when we are in waiting rooms or the such.

T-Mobile reception is good with this phone, better than with the Fire Phone, there haven't been any dead spots so far, though with my Fire Phone there were places where I couldn't get signal.  I haven't done a speed test yet but web browsing and downloading apps with WiFi disabled seems to be quicker with the Life One X.

The Life One X comes with a  decent amount of stuff in the box, it has the charger, a screen protector, a second phone back that has a flap cover, and ear buds.  I removed the original back and put the one with the flap cover on, it is of an okay quality and does it's job.

The Life One X has some other features such as smart gestures which can open the camera or turn on the led light by drawing letters on the screen, such as a letter C for the camera.  I have read some reviews which have said that having the smart gestures on may make the screen become active during phone calls, but I have not experienced this myself.

Battery life on the Life One X is okay, it seems to be slightly better than the Fire Phone.  I don't use my phone much during the day and it is at about 50 or 60% when I go to bed at night during the week.  On weekends I will probably use the phone more and would expect it to be down into the low 10s or 20% SOC.  For someone who plays a lot of games or uses their phone a lot during the day, they would probably need to charge it earlier in the day.

Charging of the Life One X can be slow at times.  With the included charger it seems to charge a bit faster than my Fire Phone, but charging via a USB port on my laptop resulted in no gains the charge percentage stayed at 51% after being plugged in for twenty or thirty minutes.  I haven't experimented too much with different chargers or charge rates but I will update this review in the future after I have.

Now onto the two problems I have had so far.

Trying to set a custom ringtone for a contact has proved impossible for me.  I have read in forums that people have been successful doing so, I just can't get it to work.  I was able to hook up my phone to my Windows 7 laptop (Windows 10 laptop did not work) and transfer mp3 files to either the phone storage or the SD card.  Once the files were transferred I was able to see them in the ringtone menu on the phone and even select them.  But after selecting them for an individual contact, I would still get the standard ringtone.  I attempted restarting the phone after setting the ringtone as well as creating a custom audio profile and then setting the ringtones, which did not work.  Currently I am using one of my mp3 ringtones as the general ringtone, but I cannot set tones for individual contacts.

The second issue that I am running into is not being able to download apps directly to the SD Card.  Even with the SD card selected as the primary storage installed apps will go to the phone storage and I have to go into the apps menu and move each one individually to the SD card.  While this isn't difficult, having to do it with every app that I install is an issue.","4.0 out of 5 stars"

First the phone feels great in the hand and the screen is beautiful. There are many features that are not spoken of on the product information that I believe are real selling points. First this is one of the few phones I have seen that has a notification LED at this price point. Second the cover in the packaging is a smart cover and not just some gel casing. This allows you to see the time and notifications as well as control music without opening the cover. When the cover is opened the phone unlocks. Lastly the front facing camera has a flash. Finally someone is doing it at this price point and there are plenty of more expensive phones without that. Android 5.1 seems to be smoother than the 5.0 on my previous phone but that could also be the 2Gb of Ram vs the 1GB of Ram which again you hardly ever see at this price point. I'll update once I put some time in.","5.0 out of 5 stars"

Screen turning on while being on the phone, overheating, unresponsive screen, after a couple of days it would become unresponsive, meaning I would have to press an app several times before it loaded it up, keys would be missed while typing, multitasking would crawl, press pause on the music and have to wait for the music to pause. It became frustrating using the phone and I went back to my Motorola Droid Turbo - Blu customer support, although polite, was very little help. They asked me to do a factory reset, which I did with no change, then they said they would email me instructions on how to do a 'hard factory reset' which I never received but found instructions online on how to do it, without any remedy.

At first it was fast, sleek, responsive, and just what I was looking for, then the problems started.
Just to name a few:
This phone doesn't allow for background apps and has no settings option that would allow it so you won't get notifications from some messaging apps even with the notifications turned on.
I was in a phone call and instead of call waiting it rang in my ear, and because I was in a phone call I couldn't turn it off or end the second incoming call.
the proximity sensor is horrible, I called my voicemail while in another call and both calls were active at the same time but I couldn't hang up with either.

I have owned few Blu phones in the past and decided to give this a try.  I've had both good and bad experiences with Blu devices in the past...I had bought Blu Life Pure Mini (both black and white) and loved it except for 4 things...GPS did not work, I couldn't do group message with any iphone users because the lack of MMS group option, lack of any firmware upgrades, and inability to add the memory.  WELL, this new phone fixed all those issues.

1.  GPS - very accurate

2.  Battery - I was worried first few times I charged the battery on this device because it took 5 hrs to get from 0% to 85% the first time...and first few times I was able to charge to 100%, it would drain down to 95% within few minutes of turning the device on.  After I went through few cycles of charging, I am able to do 100% in about 4 hrs and the charge seems to hold now.  I have no problems with the battery life after the few initial cycles.  I've owned LG G2 which had 3000 mah battery and it about the same, which is good.

3.  Screen - Very bright and impressive.  The glass is also very slick and has curved edges, like an iphone 6.  Touch is responsive and feels like much more expensive phone.

4.  Connectivity -  I had no problem connecting this phone to several of the Bluetooth devices.  It also connected to all the wifi spots I could find.  I did have some problems playing 1080p Youtube videos using the Tmobile LTE as it kept trying to buffer every 30 seconds or so...I used the Samsung Galaxy S4 in the same spot and it had no problems playing the 1080p videos.  I lowered the resolution to both 720 and 480p resolution and it didn't have any problems.

5.  Camera - for a budget phone, this phone has very good cameras.  Front even has a flash built-in although it really didn't help brighten anything up past few feet.  Camera is fairly quick and pictures came out great.

6.  Speaker - The rear mounted speaker is very small...it's hard to hear anything if you have some background noise.  It's not horrible but it will give you a bad time if you rely on your external speakers for lots of things like music or conference calls...I was able to increase the speaker volume slightly by swiping 2 fingers down from the top and on the lower left corner, picked the ""outdoor"" option under Audio profiles.

7.  Overall value - For $150 this phone is really hard to beat.  The feel is really nice (except for the back plastic cover but when a TPU case comes out, it won't be an issue) and feels almost premium.  I'm upgrading few of my back-up phones (Samsung Galaxy S4 and LG G2) with these 2 phones and I feel like it's really an upgrade.  If this phone had a finger print scanner and guaranteed upgrade in firmware, they won't be able to keep this phone in stock for $150.  Like I posted earlier, I was able to pick these up at $100 each and this phone can't be beat.","5.0 out of 5 stars"

Look and Feel: Light, it weighs nothing but good construction, but in the rear, the cover has a few sectors that are like open and gives the impression that is not perfectly adjust to the phone (not alarming). The edge of ""metal"" does not appear to metal, but rather a plastic alloy with who knows who, who gives some sense to metal, but it is okay. The power and volume buttons, are in good positions, and give good tactile feel, easy to push and give a sense of quality.

Performance: Excellent for the price, with 2GB of RAM and a processor 8-core Cortex A53 (like Snapdragon 615) can move any app smoothly, Facebook, twitter, whatsapp, Instagram, Vine, snapchat, Amazon app, all Google Apps and more, multitasking goes well and you can switch between apps without problems. Sometimes it hangs, do not know why, maybe it's incompatibility with Mediatek processor, high load, or just a crash, nothing serious but happens. Although for that price I do not think you can ask more to this phone, for example the competition, moto G 2015 has a Snapdragon 410 are 4-core Cortex A53 and 1GB of RAM, and moves well, here you will receive better or equal performance. Some casual games are also run pretty good, I do not think they have a problem with that.

Battery: (This section is the one that has disappointed me and I'll tell you why). The 2900mAh battery is great. Quite large, which can last the whole day with average use, some youtube videos, much whatsapp, vines, instagram, snapchat and facebook, text messages, calls and some other basic stuff. I've gotten from 6am until 830pm, about 4 hours of screen time. You may ask, what worries me or do not like. The charging time of the battery. 4 to 5 hours to achieve 100% load battery of this smartphone and I do not understand why. The charger that comes with this phone has an output of 5V-1A which seemed to me to allow me to charge my phone at 2:30 minutes approximately, maybe a little more, which obviously was not. Then i think, well, the battery is large enough, perhaps with a charger that has an output of 5V-2A can achieve a better result, connect it to my Powerbank Aukey QC2.0 and nothing. Ok this phone does not have QC2.0 but the powerbank can make use of an output of at least 5V-2A when QC2.0 not present. But no, this is not the case.

The truth is an excellent phone, for me it was perfect and unbeatable with that price, $ 99, but, for me, this failure when is charging, makes me leave this review somewhat angry and disappointed. Concedible to me is not having to spend 5 hours a day charging the phone to use it as I want. Maybe not a problem for some, for others maybe yes, but I think worth mentioning. You must know what u face before buying this phonet, I unfortunately did not read anything about it only good reviews about the performance and all the good price and the phone but nothing said nothing about this little detail which is pretty big for me .

Greetings to all I hope you liked my review and can help you to decide buy or not this phone. Greetings from Venezuela. Sorry for the English i know is bad :D","3.0 out of 5 stars"

so the major cons are:
## camera has a color issue, video record/playback issue, flash sync issue, very slow in dark even with flash on. it is deal breaker if you ever plan
  to use it recording anything. the only pro in this dept is it has a flash for front facing camera though(first time seeing this in any phone i used,
  again, not very useful as the flash likely fires only after people start moving). i don't know for sure this is a defeat only on my phone or the
  phone is not designed for using camera for real.
## battery last quite short, hard for a full day, charge is slow, at least twice i saw battery drop to below 5% from 50% within 5min and the phone
  became hot(no idea what heavylifting it was doing in that 5min causing the heat)
although it served majority of my need(i am not picky for the phone with this price), i am kind of regret when comparing to huawei honor x5 my friend brought for $199, seems a lot better for this $50 diff
## someone (i assume from blu) suggested me to download app open camera which i just tried, the recording does feel a lot smoothy even though the recorded clip is a bit off-focus, not ideal plus a few more steps, it is better the the builtin app which is not usable.
### for the blue tuned color, it now looks better somewhat after i switched to customer color with extra warm tone added
bottomline, with some work/help, it is not that bad that i have to stop using it, so far.","2.0 out of 5 stars"

Perhaps I'll revise this review over time.  However, for the fantastic price, I am getting a phone which is a marked improvement over my $359 Oneplus One I bought just over 15 months ago.  Call quality is excellent.  Bluetooth connectivity is easy and excellent.  The dual SIM feature will be a godsend, because my company has been pressuring me to carry a second phone and I'd rather not.  64gb on a removable sd card is more than enough.  2gb of internal memory is adequate as well.  The screen quality and brightness are excellent, and though others have complained, the sound is plenty loud (though not in Stereo).

I no longer believe that the few new and esoteric features made available in high-end phones in the last year justify 3x the price or more.  This phone more than does the job.

I love when companies like BLU come out with a device with amazing specs for very reasonable prices.

I used this phone for about 3 weeks, but then decided to return it because of quite a few issues. The first thing I did when I got the phone was set it up and download the OTA update, which was suppose to improve battery life and a few other issues. However, the issues I ran into were:

1. The headphone jack made static noises. I used two different headphones as well as two different aux cables (one in my car, one in my friend's car). The static noises were constant with the aux cables, and the static noises came and went while using the headphones.

2. The bluetooth was extremely choppy. When synced to my car, the music would continue to play on my phone, but would have choppy playback through my car speakers. My previous phone (Alcatel Idol 3) did not have this issue, nor did my other friends' phones when played in my car.

3. The screen was jumpy. Sometimes when I turned on the screen to swipe in my password the screen wouldn't properly register my touch. I would have to turn the screen off then turn it back on again for it to work. Also, when typing on the keyboard it was often jumpy, requiring to type --> delete a word or two I did not input --> type some more -- > delete another word or two I did not input, etc.

4. I would set my alarm volume to the loudest setting. However, if you reboot your phone once you have your alarms set, then the alarm volume would return to the original settings, which was the lowest sound, and you will not hear your alarms in the morning.

5. The battery life was not the best, but it was not absolutely terrible. Charging times were ridiculously long however, even with the update.

6. The speaker was terrible. I did not mind when using it for music, but when using speakerphone the other caller's voice would be pretty distorted making it hard to understand what they were saying.

7. The camera was all right, but took blurry pictures if you were not outside in a lighted area.

I did like: how thin and light the phone was, the accessories that came with it, the fact that it did not lag (even though I downloaded 20+ apps), the screen quality, and the notification light. The front camera also had an LED light which is not something you see on too many phones except flagship phones.

Again, I really wanted to like this phone, but after too many issues I decided to return it (thankfully Amazon has a great return policy).","2.0 out of 5 stars"

--  Nice case is included.  Also like the texture standard back compared to the slippery Samsung.

Some downsides so far:

--  No VOLTE or WiFi calling capability (Samsung does)
--  Phone call quality not as clear
--  Onboard speaker weak and unclear  (streaming audio is great, however)
--  Camera shutter response is slow and delayed with flash on
--  Placement of the camera lens annoying -- easy for finger interference
--  Low light pictures grainy
--  Video poor at 1080p with noticeable choppiness -- 720p recording is better  (Samsung video is smoother)

Both are very slow to connect on phone calls, which is strange.  For those on T-Mobile, this phone does support Band 12, like the Samsung.

Someone said that the HD screen on the Blu Life One X is comparable to the IPhone 6s -- it is not -- both the 6s and the 6s Plus have superior screens.  But for an sub $200 phone, this is an excellent GSM phone.","5.0 out of 5 stars"

I can say this phone does everything good Netflix and youtube run without any hiccups back when I had my moto it would freeze up just browsing the web or clicking on a video.

Bonus they add with this phone Screen protector, Case, Earbuds all included which is cool but isn't needed.

Problems I have with the Blu Life One X - The temps/HEAT are horrible I get like 50C while watching youtube for about 30 mins I'll feel like the phone is burning my hand at the lowest brightness too why such high temps does it now have a good cooling system? Or could it be all the stuff that makes it so powerful but then I look at the Galaxy S7 Edge and I see people game more then 30mins and it stays at 37C with mid brightness. I don't have messenger or Snapchat or apps that's generally use alot of resources on my phone.

After testing the data speed and graphics processing of this phone, I am impressed with the performance. The voice call clarity is excellent and my callers commented on how sharp the audio was at their end of the call. The phones weight and touch feels comfortable in the hand, and it did not get hot while operating. I also like that you can change the navigation/back button to be on the right or left side.
The Display is very bright and clear and easily compares to my sons IPhone 6 Plus which costs at least 3 times as much.
Battery life is relative to what you do with the phone, but with medium to high use (voice+data), I am able to get the advertised amount of charge which for me averaged about 16 hours, but could easily be extended by using the power saving options in the settings.

The only challenges I had with the phone was related to the Android Lollipop OS, which after investigation would have occurred on other cell phones running  the same OS. (FYI- when using custom ringtones with lollipop you will need to place the custom ringtone in the phones ringtone folder using a file manager app or connecting to a PC and using windows explore). Note: BLU will be upgrading the OS to Marshmallow in March.

I highly recommend this phone for the value based on it's capabilities.","5.0 out of 5 stars"

It feels very good in the hand and also much more expensive then it is. As mentioned by others, the screen protector does not fit the cellphone. It does does fit horizontally or vertically. I thought it would only protect the screen itself, but I was wrong; it is useless. I bought it to replace my LG G2 with which I was having screen issues, this seems better, but not a huge leap forward. However considering the LG G2's initial msrp was $550 this seems like a incredible steal and it is.

Another thing nobody mentioned is that the case is literally the back cover for the cellphone. You have to remove the back cover  and snap the cover into the back. In my opinion this is great since it reduces the bulk of having a case. As mentioned before, the charger is indeed a 5.0V/1.0 Mah power brick so it will take 4 to 5 hours to charge. Regarding battery life, I am yet to test that. I personally love the smart style case. It works perfectly and is a great addition to an already incredible deal. I have had ""Samsung"" cases for other devices which retail for $80 and those feel cheaper then the BLU case. I am very pleased.

My unit came perfectly fine, the screen looks amazing and it is pretty fast. The phone gives you the option to use the sd card as primary storage which is a missing feature in almost every android I have owned. As mentioned in the headline (in case anyone is wondering) It does work with Claro in all bands including LTE, no issues whatsoever.

For any audio enthusiasts out there the audio out is really good. One thing I loved about the LG G2 was the audio quality. The internal DAC is really good and vastly better then any Ipod or iphone I had used. This was something I would think Blu would ""cheap out"" on, but Blu has surprised me again.

To finalize, this cellphone is the beginning of the end of $500+ flagship phones. This phone is incredible, nothing can compete at this price point. Stop thinking, buy it know","4.0 out of 5 stars"

Pros:
It was very slim and light. It was just a little harder to use one handed than the Vivo Air.
dual sim and takes a memory card which the vivo air does not.

For me, this is the perfect phone as it fits nicely in the front pocket of my jeans and has a screen resolution that you had to pay $600+ for just two years ago.  I've read reviews complaining of ""lagginess"" but I've yet to encounter it.  My hunch is this is by users who cram a lot of games and data-gobbling apps on their devices.  For the rest of us, it's not an issue.  I've had 6- and 7-inch screens in the past and hate them -- they're much too bulky in my pocket and, unless you have the thumbs of monkey, one-handed usage is impossible.

I have a lot of phones; you could almost call me a collector.  I got this for my wife who was always having non-issues with her Meizu Note 2 (just wait until they come to the US) and wanted  untainted Android, not the highly worked over Flyme interface of the Meizu that was baffling at times. The LOX gave me that simple interface and is buttery smooth and never falters or stutters. I had it up and running and tweaked for power usage very quickly. While I admit that there are always some units in any production run that get a faulty component, I wonder how many issues reported in these reviews are from people who maybe need to dig a little deeper for a fix rather than trash the phone right away. Of all of the Android phones I have had over the years, and the six I have at the moment, not a single one of them came with a bad component.  I had some confusing issues no doubt, but never sent one back.  Not to say it can't happen, just never to me. Now, whats to like?
* The shape and size is just great. Easier to read than a five inch without being any wider and easier to text on than a 5.5 that can be a stretch in landscape texting and a stretch to get in some pockets. It's about as big as you can go for a one hander. The 5.2"" screen at that pixel density puts it in high end territory. Yea, I like Amoled but it's not a game changer for me.
* Build quality is right on par with the best of them. Just about all phones are made in China, even the iPhone and manufacturers have been in heated competition for years and it's just plain hard to find a junky phone at any price point except the very cheapest. The Gorilla glass screen protection utilizes the 2.5 arc design which is a very nice design touch and adds to the quality build. Decent sized bezels add to the look.
* The included flip case is really quite nice and I put it on for my wife after I set the phone up. It is not white like the phone, rather a cream color with umber tones that make it blend with the gold color of the aluminum body frame. The phone comes set up with the cover mode activated and that effects the action of the proximity sensor. One of the common complaints with this phone is ""bad"" proximity sensors. If you are not going to use the cover, head to the Personalize section of settings and deactivate it. While there, put it in pocket mode to increase the ringer volume when the cover is on or when the phone is buried somewhere.
*Connectivity is great. Strong wi-fi and bluetooth connections. Have not tried the GPS yet but have three other Mediatek 64 bit powered phones and their GPS performance is right there with the Qualcom offerings. Best of all is the antenna performance. I live in a crappy area for reception and it's always been a bit dicey getting any decent signal. I am using Cricket and LTE Discovery is reporting  -99 Db LTE reception on band 17 and I am absolutely thrilled as everything just works faster including MMS messaging which is often shaky with Cricket. GSM signal strength is also much stronger. For many people, this should be reason enough to consider this phone. Like many others, the default Cricket APN settings were wrong so I immediately made the changes to that APN.
*Sound is right in the middle of the pack. Not totally crappy and not totally great. I used engineering mode to boost the speaker output a bit and it worked out well.  With quality ear buds like the Xiaomi Hybrids, you can tell that Blu did not take a shortcut with the DSP circuitry.
* I have not really run the camera through its paces but in the few shots I did take, focus times were lightening fast and so is the shutter speed. The pictures all looked plenty good to my non-professional eye.  This is one spot where the high end phones will have an advantage as they simply have better sensors, lens and photo processors that are too expensive for this phone.  If I have any changes in my opinion, I will update.
*As for the battery life, so far I have nothing to complain about.  I got it fired up at one on Saturday and it showed 63% available.  I pushed it really hard until I went to bed at 10:30 and it had 38% showing.  I fully expect more than one full day with moderate use and personally could not drain it in a normal day unless I turned on GPS, bluetooth, Google Now and had notifications pushing for Whatsap and Facebook plus watching a lot of video. Charge time?  I don't care as I have to sleep every day so it goes on the charger then. This phone uses a lithium polymere battery vs lithium ion used in more expensive phones like my Zenfone 2 (my favorite) and should not be over amped. In fact, the lower charge rate will probably help you battery last longer and extend the phone's lifespan.
I ask you again, what's not to like?","5.0 out of 5 stars"

I have always been a fan of Blu and their phones and this doesn't disappoint in the least. First off, the phone runs on near stock  Android 5.1 Lollipop skin, which is a step above some other skins that Blu has stuck on other quality phones The phones display is perfect for one handed use and gets really bright and falirly dim. And for the price, the 1080p HD, 5.2 in. screen is unbeatable. The front 5 megapixel camera takes great selfies and the flash that comes with it works great. The rear 13 megapixel camera has great detail and is an overall great camera. If you are looking for one that rivals an iPhone or a Samsung Galaxy s6, this won't, but for $150, the camera is great. The 1.3 gigahertz octa-core processor works miracles. It is surprisingly quick and snappy with little lag. The two gigs of ram in tow help that along very nicely. It comes with 16 gb of storage onboard, but I have an extra sd card already installed. The audio quality (which often gets overlooked) is pretty good. The audio jack, which is located on the top of the phoen, gets too loud for me to put it on the loudest setting, which is a huge plus for riding in cars or flying. The given headphones do their job, but I will going off to the store soon and getting a better quality set. The right side fits fine and the left one doesn't seal in my ear. I am an audiophile and that drives me insane. The bass needs to be boosted for me and thankfully you can do that in the provided equalizer found in the music app through the settings. The speaker is somewhat quiet, like others have said, but it should not be a deal breaker. You can still adequately hear it for ringtones and videos in many different environments. The build quality is great and rivals high-end phones. The faux leather finish on the back is very Samsung Galaxy note 3 esque, which is not a bad thing at all. It adds good grip and doesn't pick up fingerprints at all. The air-brushed metal frame and the 2.5D curved screen really adds to the phones experience. The buttons on the side are metal (or so they seem) and have a nice clicky-ness when pressed. The phone comes with a high quality flip-cover case that does its job. It overlaps on the sides protecting it from bumps and minor falls, but don't expect it to protect it from concrete or hard floors. The notifications, time, and music player can be found through the opening in the front of the cover. The screen can be turned on and off a couple of different ways. It can be turned on by clicking the power button, double tapping the screen, or opening the cover on the case. It can be turned off by clicking the power button, double tapping the home button, or closing the cover. This phone is loaded with plenty of quality features and rivals the Asus Zenfone 2, Alcatel onetouch Idol 3, and blows the Moto G 3rd gen out of the water. This phone is definitely the phone for people that don't want to pay out the nose for an amazing phone.","5.0 out of 5 stars"

(I mean that) Rather than tell you all about the goodness, let me start with the very few negative points of the phone.....if any are showstoppers for you, stop reading.

1. If you buy a white one, the rear soft-feel cover gets very dirty, very quickly.
2. The phone does not have NFC, so you cannot use phone payment apps like google wallet at the cash register.
3. The WIFI is not dual-band. Might be an issue for those who work or live in very congested 2.4 ghz wifi areas.  Not a problem if you don't.
4. The camera is very good.....but only fair in low light.

That's it.  That's all.  Now I will tell you just the high points of my experience with the phone.  If I don't talk about a certain capability, assume the phone is totally competent there.

1.  The 5.2 inch, 1080P display is brilliant and gorgeous.  Just a GREAT, GREAT display.
2.  The phone has 4G LTE Band 12.  If you are a T-Mobile user, that means you get their ultra-fast long range 4G data stream where it is deployed.
3  For a 5.2 inch phone, the overall outside dimensions of the phone are very manageable in your hand. Awesome feel and balance.
4. At my usage level (High-moderate), the battery life is very good.....each evening as I shut it down, there is between 25-30% battery life left.  I have never had a low battery warning with the phone.
5. The phone is fast.

I bought one of these phones for my wife.....I got her a black one with a blue translucent case.  The phone's appearance is awesome.  My white one is pretty, but that back cover bugs me a bit.  IMHO, there is nothing about this phone to detract from a 5-star rating.  Please, please do not buy any Apple product until you handle this phone.  You will not regret it.....and you will have TONS of cash left over for H & B.  Peace!","5.0 out of 5 stars"

Processor is slow and laggy and dont even have too many apps on it. 4.

Both phones are on the same network and are literally next to each other. I don't are what anyone says, I will not buy another Blu. I wont even waste my time returning the phone for another crap even for a warranty exchange. Don't even mention the i-phone because it was no use on a trip to Tennessee and Kentucky either.

As far as specs and performance this is as good as any mid-high end phone. Call quality is good.  The screen is very nice the camera is good.  For 150.00$ you can't go wrong.  Went with Straight Talk BYOP.  Chose the ATT micro sim from the 60$ all in one starter kit followed the steps and in 10 min was up and going with all functions working and 4g signal strong for my area.

I would definitely buy another BLU phone. I think they have come a long way from the first generation dual core phones.  This is a 5 star phone for the price,  features, speed, and easy setup for Straight talk.

Update 5/15:
Phone still preforms as intended. Battery life seems to have dropped if using WiFi. No other complaints. I must have dropped phone at least 15 times never shattered screen small extremely faint scratch(hardly noticeable) Phones durability is very well. Honestly if using straight talk and have art or T-Mobile sim from them get a Blue phone this is at least 20 times better than a actual straight talk branded phone. I would not recommended Blue phones without 2gb ram, HD screen, octa-core, metal frame. All in all I will buy this phone again and highly recommend it. What folks fail to realize is we use phones and devices so much now there is no need to exspect a 2 year life. Maybe one year plus. We use these more than anything in this day so exspect it to wesr out. These are at the point of 2000 era laptops, and get used as such. I never even really have powered my device down. So I know why the battery is not as good.
The octa core processor is ridiculous. Never lags with 10 screens running, streaming etc. Way better than Straight talk branded phones . runs 64 GB SD flawlessly.
 These are the things people leave out in their review. This is a excellent phone . hoping they come out with a high 5000+ mah phone with these specs or higher. Blu is filling a nitch of the disposable phone user base. Unless you power down every night, don't drop every other week, properly charge no phone will last . and nobody got time for that.

The spec sheet hits all the right points - 2 GB of RAM, expandable storage, 8-core (!!!) processor, 1080p screen. But as I started using it, I noticed some quirks and problems that I believe are due to the odd Mediatek CPU.

Podcasts would not resume from their correct place. This happened even after restarting or using different podcast apps. If I paused a podcast and didn't resume within a minute or two, upon hitting resume it would take me back to a few minutes after the start of it. Luckily the app PodcastAddict includes an optional workaround for this very issue (the only podcast app I've found that has it). So that's taken care of.

Don't be fooled by the 8-core CPU. Demanding games cause slowdowns and stuttering. If you want to play games you'll have to turn off the music because otherwise it will slow down and sound awful. Even more mundane CPU tasks like adjusting podcast playback speed was enough to cause audio artifacts and skips in the sound. The audio problems went away as soon as I turned off audio adjustments.

I could live with those problems since there were workarounds, but what killed it was when the screen developed a dead zone, a vertical stripe right through the center making it nearly impossible to use. Luckily this happened just a couple days after I got it, so I'll be returning this phone and getting something else. I can't help but think the low price should have been a warning sign.","1.0 out of 5 stars"

Only a few have a decent volume and can be heard, and playback of videos and whatsapp audio messages is, as regards volume, a real disappointment.
There's another issue I'd like to point out. The BLU LIFE ONE 4G LTE, once it was upgraded to Lollipop, no longer offered the possibility of storing the photos taken by its camera in the external memory card - the option was nowhere to be found. I therefore expected the BLU LIFE ONE X to have corrected this issue, but it did not. It does offer the possibility of storing EVERYTHING in the memory card, including apps. But when you open the camera and go to settings, there is no storage option.
The phone looks great otherwise, but the audio problem has made me regret this purchase.","2.0 out of 5 stars"

Screen resolution, brightness, and contrast are phenomenal. Battery life is adequate for a full day of moderate to heavy usage. LTE and Wi-Fi reception are fantastic. Most phones in this price range have half the LTE band support the Life One X has. Both of it's cameras provide really nice photos in good lighting. The nearly stock, bloat free android 5.1 experience is very snappy.

Most of my gripes about the Life One X are minor. It does take a while to charge. As other reviewiers have noted,  it takes about six hours to charge fully, so, you'll need to plug it in every night. The loud speaker is underwhelming. It's really nice that it comes with a decent case and a screen protector. But my screen protector seems to be about two millimeters too narrow. It leaves a small gap of unprotected visible screen on either side.

Overall this is a great buy. I would purchase it again.","5.0 out of 5 stars"

I bought one of these for my mother to replace her old phone, i saw this a week before the special at $150 so i said let me get it for her the phone arrive all good did the transfer of sim card and it worked perfectly, so i thought. As i came back from work my mother explained to me that the battery life was really short and that everytime she took it out her purse the phone will be hot as an iron i eventually said how can it be its brand new, i tried to see if there was an issue i even updated it to the new lollipop version and that just sent the phone to not even recognize the sim card now i had a phone that battery life was bad, overheats when its off and doesn't recognize the sim, i call blue and when tried to see the issue, it ended up being defective at the end. I even research the phone and found alot of issue with the lollipop update so BEWARE. I ended up sending it back and getting a replacement for it a day later, now here i am with the new phone and i said the problem is solve, well not really the battery life still continue to be terrible lasting only like 3 hour turned off and the cpu still overheats which dont help the battery life, and when i'm talking overheat its like you turn it on make a call and talk like 10 minutes then hang up the cpu was above 100% hot, i download app to help cool down and they say it was beyond 30% of over heating im telling you around 140%, so finally i'm telling you it may be on special for 99$ and this sell bactery life will cost you a headache. battery is bad and its overheats.","1.0 out of 5 stars"

I am not into all the fancy features that most phones offer. I am not sure what exactly the Galaxy or Nexus or iPhone have as far as real nifty stuff, but if you just want a phone that:

runs quick
has all android apps
calls
texts
plays music

Than this is the phone for you. I have bought higher end phones and spent $500+ each time only to get a year, maybe two out of them (so about $250 a year cost). Then they come out with new tech, the once flagship becomes obsolete and its time for a new one. Waste of time and money imo. Before this I also had a blackberry and not only was it expensive and very glitchy but it didn't really have any apps. It was good at multitasking, calling, and emailing though (and even let you listen to music on youtube while you did something else, which this phone does not).

The phone is surprisingly fast. Again, I haven't had it for long, but assuming it doesn't have a major hardware failure (such as touchscreen), if I can get a year out of this phone with this type of speed and functionality, at $149 it is already a better buy than those expensive flagships.

The camera works fine. The Operating system works fine. I do not like the sealed in battery, but all new phones are coming out like that now.

Comes with a nice leather sheath and a screen protector. I already ruined the screen protector and I like this sheath but I am not sure where to find new ones.

I don't think BLU's customer service is very good, to be honest. I have emailed them and not heard back about some items... but, again, if the phone runs like this for a year, I would be happy. I have friends with S6's and Nexuses, and this phone is up there in speed. Maybe those are a little faster, but it isn't worth the $400 difference in cost in my opinion.","4.0 out of 5 stars"

The Life One X has a phenomenal screen, dual SIM, and expandable storage.  All features that are great.  However, after a month of usage here are my complaints.  1) The speaker on the back is bad, the Vivo XL has a much louder/clearer speaker.  2) The processor has trouble keeping up from time to time, which is expected at this price point, but the Vivo XL (which has the same processor) does not stutter nearly as often.  3). The proximity sensor does not work as it should on the Life One X.  I regularly found myself pocket dialing people or accidentally hanging up on people because the proximity sensor wasn't working 100% perfectly.

This is still a great phone for $149, but fory money the Vivo XL is the better buy.

**Start of original review**

A little background: I like to try just about every phone.  This includes high end, mid-range, and budget phones.  The Blu Life One X falls into the budget category for me.  Other budget phones I have owned: Moto G 2015 (16gb/2gb), Alcatel One Touch Idol 3.

To start, I purchased this phone for $99 during the promotional period on Amazon.  With that being said, I believe this phone is easily worth spending $149 on.  In my opinion this is the best budget phone you can buy right now.

I have had my hands on the Blu Life One X for just about a week and here are my thoughts on what is good, what is good enough, and what isn’t so good about the phone:

First the good:
The 5.2” 1080p display is excellent.  It gets very bright, and the colors are adjustable using the Miracast option in the display settings.  In my opinion this screen size is just about perfect, big enough to see easily, and small enough for one handed usage.
The battery life on this phone is excellent.  At the end of a long day of moderate to heavy usage I still have 20-25% battery.
The extras that come with the low price tag.  The fact that you get a pretty nice case and screen protector with the phone at this price is phenomenal.  Personally I dislike plastic screen protectors, but I didn’t pay anything extra for it, so I can’t complain.
The front-facing camera takes excellent selfies in every lighting setting.  The front firing flash helps this phone to even take great selfies at night.  Personally I am not a selfie person, but if you are, this phone takes great ones.
The build quality of this phone far outweighs its price.  It reminds me a lot of a Note 4 with the metal sides and pleather backing.
SD card expansion on this phone is better than normal.  Blu has found a way to allow you to default all your storage to the micro SD card.  With my 32gb high end SD card I now have 48gb of storage on this phone.
The software that Blu has put on this phone is basically stock Android.  This is important to me.  What they add on top of stock Android is useful and not bulky.  All of the extra apps can be uninstalled.

Good enough:
The 13mp camera on the back is decent.  It certainly does not compare to the quality of cameras on high end phones like the Iphone 6s or Note 5, but in good lighting it takes great pictures, and in less than ideal lighting it takes good enough pictures.
The video quality is also decent.  It will take 1080p video, but doesn’t include any kind of stabilization, so you will need to hold your hand still when shooting videos.
The processor on this phone will not blow you away with it’s speed, but it will also not disappoint you either.  I have yet to run into issues of significant lag with this phone.  Prior to this phone I had a Nexus 5x, and this phone honestly has less lag than the Nexus 5x, but still does not compete with the speed of my Nexus 6p.  This was the major flaw of the Alcatel Idol 3, it is a great phone, but the lag on that phone was unacceptable.
Call quality on the Blu Life One X is good, not great, but good.  I have no problem hearing those I’m talking to, and they seem to hear me fine as well.

Not so good:
The speaker for the phone isn’t terrible, but it isn’t good either.  I am all about front firing speakers, and I wish that this would become the norm… unfortunately it’s not, and the Blu Life One X not only has a rear firing speaker, but it’s only a average speaker at that.
While the battery life is good, as others have mentioned, it takes an abnormally long time to charge.  My solution… charge it overnight and it will easily last through the next day.

The final verdict:
This phone is the best budget phone you can get even at $149.  For $99 it feels like a steal.  As someone who has owned 80% of the high end phones out there, I feel like this phone is a real game changer.  Keep up the good work Blu, if you continue to make phones like this, I will continue to buy them.  This phone will not replace my Nexus 6p (which in my opinion is the best phone available), but for someone on a budget it is amazing!","4.0 out of 5 stars"

Overall: great specs for the price, but there are serious deficiencies that prevent it from even being a 4 star phone. Thank god I managed to get it when it was still $99. I've already returned one because of the headphone jack issue, appears to be the design of the phone.","3.0 out of 5 stars"

The low cost of this phone attracted me, as I had read a few reviews that praised the phone as being one of the best budget phones.

First off, the call quality is good and the 4G LTE on T-Mobile works excellently. Below I will explain the other features of the device.

Packaging
The phone comes packaged with the charger, a set of ear buds, a cheap screen protector (the phone has Gorilla Glass) and a faux leather flip case with a little window.

Design
the phone looks kinda like a cross between a Note 4 and an iPhone 6.
It has a plastic rear cover with a fake leatherlike texture, and the frame is made from high-quality aluminum and feels very good in the hand.
It looks MUCH better if you actually see one than in the pictures here.

Display
The display is a 5.2 inch Full HD (1080p) IPS LCD panel.
To put it simply, it looks gorgeous. Colors are vivid and crisp, and the screen is also pretty bright even at minimum brightness.
In the settings, you can use Miravision to adjust the display. I like to keep it on Vivid Mode, it makes the colors really pop out.
I also noticed that the touchscreen is very responsive, which is nice.

Performance
The phone uses an Octa-core Mediatek chip clocked at 1.3 GHz with 2 GB of RAM.
For pretty much any task, the phone preforms very well. In the 3 days that I've used it so far, I've noticed no major lag and webpages load pretty quickly.
Gaming is also surprisingly good here. I was able to play Mortal Kombat X and Dead Trigger 2. They never lagged unless a bunch of stuff was going on at the same time, then it would slow down for a few seconds.

Battery Life
The 2900 mAh battery is unfortunately sealed in, but battery life is pretty good. I am able to get just under 5 hours of screen-on time with what I would describe as moderately heavy use.
Many other people with this phone are apparently having issues with the phone taking a long time to charge.
Using the included charger, I have only charged the phone once so far (from 21% to 98%) and it took a little less than 2 hours to charge. Apparently the slow charging is an issue with most people, but so far I see no real problem seeing as how the battery is good enough to last me the whole day with more than 20% to spare, so I can just charge it overnight no problem.

Storage
The phone has 16GB of storage (10 is available out of the box), and you can use a MicroSD up to 64GB.

Overall, I think that this is a very good phone.
I personally like it. It's not a match for a flagship like the Galaxy S6 or LG G4, but for $150 you're getting some serious bang for your buck here.","5.0 out of 5 stars"

BLU should do some more QA before releases update.
Another thing is, just stop including cheap headphone already BLU. it costs you money, and the included headphone is POS no one will ever use.
Overall it is an above average phone for $149, and it was a fantastic deal for the $99 promotion price tag when it was first launched. Also I start to see some after market accessory for this phone available, that is a good thing.
Hopefully this phone's battery lasts. I had bad experience with other BLU phone's battery.
If this phone last for a year, I will come back to make it 5 stars.","4.0 out of 5 stars"

For those of you who are serious music lovers, this allows me to drive my Audio-Technica ATH-M50 headphones or any headphones properly.with the best possible sound digitally from the phone. As for the normal phone functions they are great too and the included folding case is actually better than I thought it would be in use. I was not sure if I would have liked it but after dropping and smashing two previous Blu phones, I really prefer the wrap around case. It folds right bak on itself so you can use the phone normally. The phone and case which replaces the phone's rear cover is extremely thin so the folded back case does not make the phone bulky at all. It charges really quick in my opinion compared to my other phones. This is my first octo-core phone and it is fast enough for me. As usual the dual sim feature and now 4G speed for the data is superb. Web pages and streaming services work fine.

I was actually quite surprised by the quality of this phone.  I was expecting a much cheaper feel.  It feels very solid in the hand.  I was showing some people at work and they were surprised as well given the price.The folio case and the textured back are nice bonuses.  I have been using the folio case while I wait for a slim case to arrive.  The phone works very well with it.  The battery life has been outstanding so far.  I am looking at 2+ plus days of my normal use on a full charge.  I will admit that I am a light user for the most part but I have a lot of screen on time checking messages and multiple email accounts.  Almost all preinstalled apps can be removed except 2 from BLU.  I have not noticed any heat issues at any point.  I run waze while driving and charge at the same time.

I am using the phone on TMobile and reception is good.  I pick up 4g almost everywhere I go which is an 80 mile stretch of mixed driving of interstate and county roads.

The bad:
It takes forever to charge.  No joke.  Don't be in a hurry and need to charge your phone.  You might as well plan on charging it overnight if it is anywhere close to low.  I have also been having some issues with swiping keyboards.  It starts registering my swipes as clicks and things get messy.  I have noticed it in other places as well.  I hope its software based and gets fixed soon.

The volume and power buttons are also placed weird.  I find myself constantly pressing the power button while handling the phone.  Since its pretty much in the middle of the frame, my car mount squeezes the power button if I'm not paying attention.  The micro USB port is also offset on the bottom which also caused issues for my car mount since it has a piece to rest the bottom of the phone on.  It's right where the USB port is.

Overall:
Seems like a good phone so far.  I am waiting to hold judgement until I have owned it for awhile.","4.0 out of 5 stars"

1. I have disabled or uninstalled all default apps like amazon, google apps (except gmail, search, maps and drives), opera, touchpal, games, etc.
2. Disabled auto sync of applications
3. Turned OFF Wi-Fi instead using 4G.
I am keeping it under observation for battery life. If it is not improving then I have to return it without any choice.

A week after that date, the volume rocker fell off. It wasn't dropped, it wasn't mishandled, it just fell off. I now have a hole on the side of my phone, volume control that I now need to go into the settings to address, and unsure of any remedies (whether through Amazon or Blu). All of my previous smartphones are in great shape after roughly a year and a half of use per device. This phone is falling apart after a month. Unbelievable. I'm furious.

UPDATE, 1/26/16, 5 Stars: After trying a lot of different methods to add a custom ringer, nothing seemed to work, but Blu sent out an update today and the issue has been addressed. So, I have zero complaints when it comes to this device. It's a steal at this price and I'm glad I decided to give it a shot.

Now that I've had the phone for some time, I'm upgrading my rating to five stars. It hasn't given me any other issues, I'm not experiencing any hiccups with the OS, and the battery, even after a day spent hiking and shooting photos, seems to be performing well within its expected range (i.e. it's not dying on me, even under a full day's work).

ORIGINAL REVIEW, 4 Stars: The phone is impressing me. I'm coming from a first gen Motorola Moto G 4G LTE that I loved, so I'm relieved that I don't miss it.

My only complaint is that I'm having trouble adding a custom, mp3 ringtone (as are others). I'm hoping it's a simple fix.","1.0 out of 5 stars"

Overall, I think you can go better with another phone. The BLU Life One X 2016 lacks from severe quality issues, it seems that they never stressed the phone before ship it. Would never ever buy this brand again. I would rather spend a few more bucks and buy a Motorola Moto G  (3rd generation).","1.0 out of 5 stars"

The first was originally purchased as a temporary replacement for a much more expensive name brand phone.  The second was purchased to replace an outdated phone.  We quickly discovered that this phone was not only more durable, but had more power than the name brand phones it had replaced.  It has very little bloatware in comparison to name brand phones.  It has A LOT of power.  I am able to run many apps at the same time with zero issues.  Even with the extra processing power, the battery still lasts all day.

The only issue I have found is that it charges slowly, in comparison to other phones.  To solve this problem, I set the phone to shut off automatically at 1AM and turn on automatically at 5AM.  It charges much faster during this nightly downtime.","5.0 out of 5 stars"

Display is great, phone is sharp, and battery is 8\10. Will get 12 hours of normal use, 5 screen on time. Only bad thing is the charging time. It's loooooong. I'm a charger freak, all my chargers and batteries are Anker Power IQ and they are beast but not with this phone.

The best way to charge this unit is with the charger it comes with. The processor limits the MA count. Look at it like the iPhone 5. That specified 1amp charger is the best you could go with. Even tried a blu 2amp charger from another phone and doesn't make any difference.

Overall it's a good phone, the charging problem doesn't bother me much. I have a shield tablet for my media.

Let me tell you it is acting brand new still and the battery life is still amazing. This is probably the best purchase I have ever made. Before purchasing this phone I was in the phone market and I was astounded by how expensive cell phones are. I am in my 20s so I am pretty on par with today's technology but I know damn well an Iphone is not worth $600. Anyways, this phone is amazing, all the apps run smooth with no issues and the camera quality is just amazing. I was super surprise that the phone came with its own case which was nice. The downfall is since this isn't a well-known phone company I cant find a car mount or a cute case for it. Also it took FOREVER to ship even though I picked two day shipping and paid extra it took over 2 weeks to be delivered. I called amazon costumer care and they refunded my for shipping and added $10 to my account which was nice. I've read reviews where people said the sound is muffled but I only notice the sound being muffled when i'm listening to to music and the folding case is covering the speaker. I use to own a Samsung Galaxy s4 and I would have to charge it at least three times a day ( I am on my phone a lot). I only charge this phone once and the charge last all day and then some.

I owned (and absolutely loved) the BLU STUDIO 5"" C HD in hot pink, for the past few years. THAT phone was resilient, sturdy, fast, gorgeous and everything you want in a smartphone. Therefore, I had high hopes for this newer Blu model. Not only did the Blu Life One X not meet any of my requirements, it actually set a new low. Here's 10 reasons to skip this model, not in any particular order.
  #1. The advertised 13mp camera is awful. I haven't got a single clear, bright or sharp picture. I also guarantee that this phone DOES NOT HAVE GORILLA GLASS, AS ADVERTISED! This screen looks like it will shatter with the slightest mishap. It has major issues reading touch unless fingers are (very) warm. As you'd imagine THAT isn't fortunate for me, seeing as I live in Alaska!
  #2. The stock Contacts and Dialer S U C K. There is one thing both can do- call. You click a contact, it calls. There's NO option to edit Contacts or add pictures, to block or add ringtones etc., etc.!
  #3. The screen protector provided IS NOT for this phone, it barely covers the actual part of the screen that lights up, let alone the whole screen! Maybe 60% is covered... a strip down the middle. HUGE FAIL! Besides being annoying its also pretty pointless. The edges of the glass screen are slightly curved so its possible that's why the protectors suck, but i doubt it since they stick just fine. I know since I first applied the screen protector starting from the top right corner before I sat back and saw half the screen left uncovered and vulnerable! The keyboards enter and backspace are only partially covered so the majority of the time it doesn't read when they're pressed. Add that onto the already horrible touch point reading and this review really took forever to write!!!
  #4. There are no cases. Along with the phone you get a cheap white flip cover that caused both my husband and I to nearly drop the phone numerous times. I searched all over online and even accidently ordered the wrong one since there is a ""Blu life One"", "" Blu Life One X"", and "" Blu life One XL"" and even though they look identical, they are vastly different. So yeah, lets do the math...  No cases+ No screen protectors = Broken phone.
  #5. When flip cover  case is on there at first glance is an ""S Screen"", like the Samsung Galaxy S smartphones have. NO. It is only a black and white clock that sucks battery.  No options to even change the color or disable.
  #6. THE BATTERY is the biggest issue by far. Advertised is this amazing, huge battery with some ridiculously embellished battery life statistics from talk time to idle battery use. These ""statistics"" are blatant lies! While using the phone, the battery LITERALLY continues to drain EVEN WHILE PLUGGED IN TO CHARGE! You have to turn screen off to charge and not touch it for at least 3-4 hours to get a full battery. THEN it dies in 45 minutes if you're shopping online or otherwise using it, and thats with the screens display turned 100% down and dimmed, with 10 second screen shut off if idle. THAT IS HORRIBLE! And I am so serious. I considered maybe my phone was just messed up but my husband bought one too and he has the same issues.
Lastly, something that isn't disclosed before buying is that you cannot pull the battery, it's built into phone. This is a huge design flaw for an android. These types of devices are like a computer, everything continues running in the background even after you've closed it. Every once in a while you're supposed to PULL THE BATTERIES for 30 seconds before restarting. That allows your device (phone) the opportunity to restart everything so all the ""RAM"" being used wont slow your phone down, or cause freezing. All you can do with this phone is restart it and cross your fingers it will help. As they age this will become a bigger and bigger issue, mark my words.
  #7. The android installed is the WORST made and so far 60% of the apps I've used and relied on for years, dont work on it. This includes every widget so far besides the lame white google search WHICH IS PERMANENT on your home, no removing.  The not working widgets also DEPRESSINGLY includes all APW widgets (android pro widgets) , wallpaper setting apps like wallpaper wizardrii, volume controls, status bar replacements, quite a few launcher replacement apps though thankfully my HOLO works... Ram cleaners and app closing apps do not work, including the pointless one included on device. Pretends to but upon opening settings youll see all apps open for hours with large ram and cache stores in use.
  #8. There is no menu, back or home buttons. Instead at the bottom of the screen there are permanent icons for back and home ONLY (NO MENU!!!) and of course it comes laid out so they're backwards (so back is on the left and home on the right). Without the menu button you can't manage apps, launcher, pages, etc. To close apps you have to go the long way through settings each time!
  #9. There is only 1 home screen. Apparently android tried copying apple, so to get a second page added to your home screen you have to go to the apps, hold and drag over to add a page. You HAVE to have at least one app on each page OR it automatically deletes the page. HATE HATE HATE!!

For me it's an upgrade from a Blu Dash 4.0, so quite a jump.  As long as it doesn't start to lag and freeze like my old phone I think it will keep me happy.

The skin is not heavy and bloated it's perfect what I like about it is the added firmware touches like dynamic range settings for color and contrast that no other customer ROM offers.  Camera was decent but again more than you expect from paying $100.  It's just amazingly smooth for the SoC that comes onboard I was shocked I mean it won't blow out benchmark scores but hell it's all about the user experience I have a OnePlusTwo and lags and freezes at times I think I will get an RMA replacement I'm pretty sure it's hardware.","5.0 out of 5 stars"

And I bought it due to the nice reviews I read here. That said, I see no need to keep watering a tree that's had all it needs from many others. Instead, I'll share how to ""fix"" an issue that another reviewer had with setting downloaded ring tones. His problem was that his downloaded ring tone kept reverting back to one of the stock ring tones the phone comes with.

Here's the solution for that:

Go into Settings --> Sound & notification. There's a menu in the upper right hand corner. Click it and select Add Audio Profile. I named mine My Ringtones. Just give it a name. From this new profile, you can set any ring tone you like.

And that's a poor man's contribution to those who might run into the same problem. Enjoy folks!","5.0 out of 5 stars"

Pros:
1. Speed: I don't notice any lag when using the phone, thanks to the 2GB memory.
2. Display: The 5.2-inch display is bright and vivid.
3. Dual SIM: both support LTE, plus a separate microsd slot. Some dual sim phones use the second SIM slot as a microsd slot (Huawei P8 lite, etc).
4. Software: close to pure Andriod OS, no bloatware (Asus ZenFone 2 comes to my mind here)
5. Battery life: with normal to light usage, I can use it for about one and half day.

Cons:
1. Speaker: as the other reviewers mentioned, the speaker is weak.
2. Call Quality: the voice sounds a little muffled, and sometime there is some static noise.
3. Camera: sometimes it is difficult to focus, especially on white objects, such as the back of a check. I am having trouble depositing checks because of this issue (tried Wells Fargo and a credit union). I am not sure if it is because I got a defective one or it is a bug in the design.

I really like the dual sim and separate microsd slot design. However, the camera issue bothers much. If you don't care about the camera, this could be the best budget phone with dual sim support.

[Update] The call quality is a false alarm. However, the camera turns out to be a deal-breaker for me. In the end I returned this phone.","3.0 out of 5 stars"

I do not have an upgrade thru ATT till December.  I needed a smartphone that was roughly the same size, used ATT, that supported the apps I use for school. I was just about to give up and spend  about 300 on a refurbished iphone 5s, which I didn't want. At the last minute I saw this one, saw it had generally good reviews, and bought it.

I also bought the 32 gig micro SD card because the phone doesn't have very much storage room. It's 13 bucks, I recommend you get one.

When I got the phone, it was packaged safely and was in the original box from BLU. It comes with the phone (obvi), a charger, some headphones, a case and a screen protector.

The phone was at 56% when I received it and it was just enough battery to put all my stuff back on my phone and have it set up the way I had my LG G3 set up.

Google Play had an error- but signing out and signing back in fixed it.

The phone is great. It's light, sleek, stylish. At a distance, it could pass for the new iphone. I got the white, which has a gold border. It's nice, guys.

It's well made, doesn't feel like a cheap prepaid or chinese phone.

Now, after the phone died I plugged it up to charge. It got stuck in a loop of optimizing apps which worried me, but after I unplugged the charger and plugged it back in it quit. The phone charges VERY slow with the charger it came with. I switched to the charger my LG came with and it charged completely in about an hour.

Call quality is great, the headphone jack works perfectly without any static. The speakers are a little quiet, but it's really not an issue. I hooked it up with bluetooth in my car, the call quality and music works great. I then hooked it up with a aux cable and the music quality was still great with no static.

This phone is great. I planned on just using it till December when I could get a 'real' phone, but I like this one so much I don't think I'll switch to apple or back to LG. I really REALLY like this phone. It's solid and for a good price. There really isn't anything wrong with this phone. I'd say it's just as good or even better than androids carried by ATT. I prefer BLU to my LG, my Iphone, Xperia, galaxy, etc. I go through phones a lot.

If and when I break this one, I will be buying another. This is just too good of a deal to pass up.","5.0 out of 5 stars"

I've been using Windows for the last few years and love them, but the lack of apps is annoying.

I'm also a medium-heavier user, I read yahoo sports, check out instagram, twitter, check the weather, watch a little YouTube(a couple short videos), browse amazon, ebay, and some texting.

On to the life one x, this is a really nice mid-range phone. The build feels good in the hand, light but not cheap. I like both cameras (but honestly I'm not a camera guy/camera snob) but they both take really good pictures. The screen is beautiful, actually they could have scaled that back to 720, which would have improve the battery life. Moving on to the battery, this to me is the biggest down side of the phone. Don't get me wrong it doesn't ruin the phone, but I was not impressed. Especially after reading and watching a bunch of reviews saying that it had ""a really good battery life""... It doesn't... It's average at best. I take it of the charger around 7:30ish am and by 3:00 pm I'm around 35-43% and that's from doing what I stated earlier. Now maybe to some that's good battery life or maybe I'm jaded coming from Windows, both my last two phones wouldn't be at 35-43% range til 930-10pm. So if you do what I stated earlier and more, just be prepared to charge it again before dinner. If your a lighter user or don't mind putting it back on charge than no big deal. Even given all this it's still not a deal breaker if you looking for a nice inexpensive phone. I will say the touch screen is a little sensitive and I open/click on stuff quite often by accident (going to take some getting use to). I've read a few reviews about there being no cases, Check eBay...Wiko Fever 4g...there are a couple TPU cases. I will also agree with other reviewer's that the speaker is not that great, volume wasn't really a issue for me, more the quality, still use able and get the job done....just not great. I'm also having trouble sending and receiving pictures (might be a carrier issue or something might be wrong with my model) I'll updated that later when I find out what's up, hopefully its something simple. As of now I'm giving it 4 stars depending on the sending and receiving pictures it could go down to 3. And if you wondering why I gave it 4 stars, I still like the phone and the price (I paid $149). Now if this was a 350-400 dollar phone I'd only give 2 and only 1 of it can't send pictures. Just remember what your paying for, your not buying a flagship device. So don't expect it to act like one.

Update: I did end up fixing the issue, it was the APN, (if you don't know what that is, they're some really helpful videos on youtube and some great articles on google)  but after I changed/updated it the stock messenger still wont send or receive pics. I ended up downloaded Go SMS Pro and re-entered the APN thru that app and now it works...it still wont thru the stock messenger tho. But i just made that my default SMS and disabled the stock one. Now i'm good to go.
Update: on the battery life, like I stated earlier i'm switching back to Android and i'm still not use to all the little custom things that can be done or things that can be tweaked to help improve battery life. Once again some excellent videos on youtube, example system settings, push notifications, apps in the background. Since I've made some changes the battery life has improved, instead of be at the 35-43% range around 3 pm, its looking more like 4:45-5:20ish range. Which is still not all day, but it is better. Even tho its only about two hours better, its still something. And instead of having to throttle back how much i use my phone around 2:30-3:00ish now i don't have to worry til about 5.","4.0 out of 5 stars"

Unfortunately, this phone is becoming a bigger disappointment.  2 huge issues have come up:
1 - The phone is virtually unusable while being charged.  The screen has multiple errors when i try to type or enter my security code to unlock the phone.  Unacceptable and something that I have never seen in a phone.

2- While talking on the phone, the screen continues to activate because my face is touching it.  i have accidentally opened apps just because I was talking on the phone.  Again, not acceptable and I have never had this happen on any other phone.

I originally scored this at 4 stars and am now taking 2 stars away.  These are major flaws and no, I would not not buy this phone again nor would I recommend purchasing it.

The Life One X is replacing my Ascendmate2, and I have to say I am pretty happy with the purchase so far.

Pros:
- 2 GB Ram on a budget is a huge plus.  Enough to do multitasking and have multiple apps in the background without much stutter
- Minimal bloatware is included.  This is a huge deal, especially when you only have 16GB as your only option for space.  You do have an SD card slot which helps as well.
- Like other reviews have said, it's close to a stock Android interface.  Some may or may not like this, but it is certainly a smooth interface for this phone and I have no complaints on this one.
- Mediatek processor feels quick, and I've had no issues with any games running slowly or any other apps performing poor
- The screen is clear and bright.  I'm making an adjustment going from the 6"" screen of the Ascendmate2 to the 5.2"" of the BLU, but the screen is much brighter and crisper on the BLU.
- Nice perks of the included screen protector and the snap on case.  Something nice, especially at the price point.

CON
- I wish the phone would weigh just a little bit more to feel the ""heft"".  The phone is very light, but this is just a personal preference for me.
- The camera does not do well in low light situations.  Even with the flash on, there is a lot of shadowing that occurs.
- Battery life is average.  I'm a bit spoiled coming from the extra long battery life of the Ascendmate2.  Quick charge would have been a nice feature, but at this price point, I can't complain.

For $149, I believe it's the best bang for the buck. It's very fast, and I have been able to multitask with different apps without much lag. The battery lasts about a whole day with average use, but I will agree with others that it takes a while to charge from 0%. I usually start charging when I'm around 30% anyway, and it takes about 1.5 hours to get up to 100%. The camera is ok, but you can't really expect much when paying $149 for it. I would rather have had a 5.0 MP with a great lens, than having 12 MP with an ok lens.

On Snapchat, it makes my videos look like something out of Sin City. I believe this has something to do with the phone, because my Nexus 5 didn't do that.

Overall, you can't really complain for paying $149. It's a steal at this price.","4.0 out of 5 stars"

So I made the jump to Android with this phone plus a 64Mb microSD card. I use my phone for apps, calls, email and texting. I don't do much with the camera, games or video. I do use it it quite a bit every day (1-4 hours). Android took some getting used to but I like it now. Not quite as much as IOS but it's close. The phone itself is really nice. I'd buy another one. In fact I'd like to get my spouse one.

Pros:
The display is simply excellent. Bright, even in sunlight. Really good resolution.
It is fast with no noticeable lagging.
Android version seems to be close to stock as far as I can tell.
Battery life, given my use, is excellent. I get 1.5 days all the time, sometimes 2 days on a charge.
Call clarity is really good.

Cons:
Charging time is lengthy. If I use the provided charger it is about 3 hours from 5% left.
If I use another charger, such as my old iPhone charger, it will take hours more. And sometimes it will not charge at all depending on the charger.
While calls are clear, the volume is too low for my taste. I have it at max for most calls. I do have some moderate hearing loss so factor that in for yourself. But my iPhone was plenty loud so it is not all me.
Two or 3 times in the month I have had the phone, bluetooth died. It took a reboot to get it back.

Overall a really nice phone. And a lot less than an iPhone.","4.0 out of 5 stars"

I switched to this phone from the BLU Life One and man do I love it. The screen is very crisp and the colors pop. It's lightweight especially for its size which I love. It feels very nice in the hand especially with the leather back and the case feels great too. The power and volume buttons are very responsive and have a great feel to them. I also love how smooth the screen feels. I don't experience any lag when multitasking which is great when coming from the BLU Life One. Gaming is a great experience as well. The only thing that could be better is battery life. I feel like my original BLU Life One lasts longer. I left the phone just sitting at around 80% last night and when I woke up it was at 8% . now I know that might sound normal but in comparison I left my original  BLU Life One in the same state and I'm now using it to write this review and its at 75%.

If Someone else who has one can confirm this is normal ill probably keep it, if not ill be returning it.

UPDATE (READ FOR CHARGING HELP) So I woke up and decided to switch the included charging cable with the cable from my lg phone i was using before and it so far has charged 20% in about 20-25 minutes. Im still using the included charger, because the lg charger made no difference. I guess the included cable is really bad, but switching the cable with another helped me A LOT. I went from 61% to 82% in about 30 minutes.

When I first got it, I wouldn't have put it at 5 stars because I had issues with the battery.  It took way to long to charge up, and the battery life wasn't great.  About a week after I got it, the phone notified me that it had an update available.  What a difference that made!  It now charges quickly, and I can go all day without needing to charge.

This phone has an amazing screen.  Video looks just amazing on here.  Both cameras are great, and both have a flash, which is great!  The sound is not that loud, but at this price point I do expect that you have to give a little bit somewhere.  It also comes with a great case and screen protector - something I haven't gotten with other brands in the past.

Overall, I would definitely recommend this phone.  It's well worth the price.

***Update: I've been using this phone for the past 5 months and still really like it.  I've even unfortunately dropped it a couple times with no ill  effects.  It still runs well, holds battery charge and charges back up well, and the display is beautiful for watching videos.

I do have a few issues though - and if I paid full retail price for the phone then these issues might concern me more... but I didn't.
1- The rubberized back plate doesn't fit completely flush to the aluminum frame on the corner used to peel it off.  I'm temporarily using the included sheath until my TPU case arrives from Spain, then that should take care of that problem.
2 - I've been noticing some phantom vibrations.  It will vibrate as if I have a message, but there is nothing there.  I don't know if its the phone or a malfunctioning app.
3 - The camera is slow and not that great, but I'm not a big camera user anyway - which means I haven't dove into any settings that could possibly speed it up.

I'm not thrilled about the non-removable battery, but I knew that going in.  However battery life is good and operation is fluid.  Bloatware is minimal.  Screen is great.  People complain about slow charging time but it seems normal to me - about the same as my old Nexus 4 but allowing for a larger battery.  I initially thought I would use the dual SIM feature with both TMobile for data and ATT MVNO for voice, but I wound up exclusively with Cricket wireless right before I received the phone so I never tested that feature.  I got sick of horrible battery life on Android phones and switched to Lumias, but eventually their shortcomings caught up.  This is the phone that put me back on Android.  After spending hundreds of dollars on phones in the past only to be disappointed in them one way or another, I decided I would NEVER spend more than a hundred bucks on a phone ever again.  Luckily I was able to grab this during the launch sale.","4.0 out of 5 stars"

One was the stock keyboard which, when updated via Google Play became malware to anyone who isn't a savvy Android user. Because it shipped from Blu, it couldn't be uninstalled - you could only reset the app and deactivate it.  I don't believe Blu had anything to do with that app as several vendors got nailed by it but I would have expected a patch to remove it instead of making people live with that crap on their phone.

From the beginning - and what at last killed the phone - were battery problems.  Blu may have known this modal had issues because the only update I received from them dealt with the battery....which eventually shorted out and destroyed the phone. Before that, it would discharge at amazing rates.  Even with the screen off and phone in standby it would literally discharge at 1% per minute sometimes. I would have returned it but the problem was very intermittent so I wasted time determining if it was an app that was responsible.

Reason for giving this a 3 star review instead of 5, for the price bracket, is that I received the phone on the 5th of May, 2016 and as of the day of this review, May 25th, I have not been able to get any form of vibration from this phone. What I mean by no vibration? No vibration while ringing, no haptic feedback, nothing.

I haven't done any reset yet cause I have all my apps set up how I want. Don't want to bother with that again.

Alarm clock choices are not loud enough to wake me and I am a light sleeper. The reason for my returning of the phone is the battery. Takes all day or night to charge and in about 4 hours of app use or web browsing and texting it needs to be charged again. And no I don't use my phone every second of every day but I do use it when I am waiting at the dr office to play games or text people and today was the first time I really took it out of the house and I used it well it failed that test lol every 5 minutes a battery percentage would fall.

I am writing this review based on a few hours' use, and will update or add new findings to this review as I use it more. Ask me any questions about the phone if you have any.

Background information
I am quite familiar with iOS, Android, Windows, OS X. I have been developing software.
Phones I own right now: Galaxy S4, Galaxy Nexus, Moto G (2013)
Phones I had owned before: Atrix, Galaxy S3, iPhone 5, etc.

Performance
I worried about the performance because it uses a MediaTek CPU which has a bad reputation. I did some basic stuff like installing apps, watching YouTube, or browsing the web, etc. It definitely is faster than Galaxy Nexus, and Moto G. It could be due to 2GB RAM instead of 1GB like Moto G has. I could not feel noticeable lag or slowness. It feels perhaps even faster than Galaxy S4 or Nexus 7 2013 for some tasks. I ran Geek Bench. Keep in mind total score is quite arbitrary value because of the weights used. One X's single-core score was a little bit lower than that of Galaxy S4. One X's multi-core score was a little higher than that of Galaxy S4. At this price point, I have no complaints about the performance as of yet.

I do not play games, but I just ran Asphalt 8 as a test. It lagged with High visual quality. It was playable bit still a little bit not smooth with Medium visual quality. On Galaxy S4, this game runs quite smoothly with High visual quality. Basically, if you expect you could play high quality 3D games smoothly on a phone at this price point, it ls like a person who wants to play Crisis at maximum settings on an Intel Atom netbook.

Look and feel
I like how it looks, probably one of the best I have seen for years. It looks thin and sleek, due to its rounded edges. Moto G feels twice as thicker than One X, and feels heavy. There is some sort of metal rounding around the edge, and the back cover is removable. The problem is, the narrow area between the metal edge and the plastic cover is a little bit recessed, so when you are holding the phone you can feel it. This does not feel good. Galaxy S4 also has fake metal rounding and back cover, but it does not have this problem. Also, the back cover plastic feels really thin and cheap. I am not a person who just hates plastic for being plastic. I never ranted Galaxy S4 being plastic. S4's plastic back cover feels solid and when you tap on it, it does not rattle. It seems that there is slight gap between the back and the back cover, and since the back cover is thin, when you tap on it, it rattles. It is not a big problem, but a little bit annoying. Even Moto G's plastic back cover feels a lot solid and high-quality than One X's.

Screen quality
I am very satisfied with the screen, especially at this price point! It is very bright and colourful, so it just looks good. Mine has no light-bleedings on the corners or any dead pixels like my Moto G, which has both light-bleedings and a dead pixel (could be a dust under the glass). Also its resolution is 1080p, miles better than Moto G.

The only small problem is, that the minimum brightness is too bright. I compared the minimum brightness with other devices' minimum brightness. One X's minimum brightness was the brightest. I would say, its minimum brightness is twice as bright than Nexus 7 (2013).

Loud speaker sound quality
I would say, an average quality for a phone. I watched many reviews before I received it, and I worried about the speaker quality, because some reviewers said the speaker was very tinny and sounded bad. I tested it and it wasn’t really bad. As a proof, I have recorded a video in which I compare the speaker qualities of four phones. Moto G's loud speaker was a bit better as its maximum volume is louder and it sounded a little bit clearer. But for watching YouTube videos (mainly talking), the difference not that noticeable unless you directly compare the two side by side.

A little bit disappointing is the popping noise of the headphone jack when playing sound starts/ends. I think this happens because internally it turns off the analogue sound output to save energy and then turns it on when playing sound. My cheap Lenovo laptop also has this problem. Moto G also has this problem but its noise is a lot milder. High-end devices (at least at their debut) like Galaxy S4 or MacBook do not have this problem. Anyways, this happens only when play starts/ends, not during the playback.

System language
It has about 20 languages including English, French, German, or Chinese. But it does not have Japanese or Korean. I am fine with English, but a small problem is there are no variants. I use British English, but there is only English which is US English. On Nexus devices, there are many variants of English, such as United States or United Kindom.

Undeletable Applications
There were only a few applications when I first turned it on. It had McAfee Security, Yahoo Weather, Opera, some Amazon stuff. First, I deleted MacAfee right away, because I think those kinds of applications are generally scams themselves (I also hate that John McAfee). Almost all could be installed or disabled. Here is the list of applications that are not part of Android or from Google and cannot be uninstalled nor disabled. When compared to phones from Samsung or LG, there is almost no bloatware at all.
-- BLU Help (just a shortcut to their web site), File Manager, FM Radio, TouchPal 2015 (default keyboard), Videos (seems to be a video player).

OS
Right after I turned it on, I checked for system update. There was no update. OS version is BLU_LIFT_ONE_X_V12_GENERIC_5.1_20151009-1848. The Android version is 5.1. Kernel version is 3.10.65.

Problems
When I touch the upper part of the phone, Bluetooth sound is complete stops. I have had many other phones and tablets, but I have never seen anything like this. So, basically, when you are holding this phone with the hands in landscape mode, you cannot listen to your Bluetooth audio.

Small good things
It shows small red light on the top left bezel when charging. I hate when a phone does not have a charging light, because then I would have to turn on the screen to see if charging is done or not.
I can turn it on by double tapping the screen when it is off.
Haptic feedback is acceptable. I think Samsung's the best because they feel like springs. Moto G's is worst because it is noisy and feels like some small motor is rotating. One X's does not feel springy like Samsung's but mild and soft, a lot better than Moto G's.
It has two LED flashes, one on the back, and one on the front.
The package contains a lot of stuff: LCD protection film, earphones, flip cover, charger, cable. I probably am not going to use them other than the protection film, perhaps. But they could be valuable to some people.

Small bad things
The USB port is on the left, not on the centre, of the bottom side. And it is upside down, like that of Nexus 7.
The edge is probably made of metal. When charging, I can feel slight electric current there.
The buttons are a little bit too pointy and feel cheap, compared to Galaxy S4. But when compared to Moto G, they are about the same quality.
There is a slight gap between the bottom of the phone and the back cover,especially near the concave area for your finger nail.","5.0 out of 5 stars"

Its a good deal for anyone who just wants a proficient smartphone. The accessories were nice for the most part. However, the screen protector supplied was marginally smaller than the screen. Also the system software takes up approximately 6 GB of the phone storage so its best you get a memory card. Im happy with the performance so far. You get about a lapproximately 5 hours screen time which doesnt exactly last a full day if you're always on your phone. Good things is that the charger charges quickly so you'll be up from 0 to 100% in a littel00le more than 3 hours","4.0 out of 5 stars"

I`m very glad with the first experience, but not with this second.

Since the days of subsidized phones appear to be over I evaluated my options.  First I use the phone for work email and calls, listening to streaming radio over a hour car ride, android development, and personal use.  Maybe small games, some social media.

It really makes me question why everyone flocks to the expensive brands when I have this BLU phone for two weeks and I notice no change in behavior from my old phone.  The BLU phone does everything I need (plus) without all the ATT bloatware.  Ok, if you need the latest eyeball tracking crap Samsung promotes that most of us turn off after we play with it for 5 min then maybe this isn't for you.  It isn't loaded with features outside of stock Android.  It is way faster than my old S4.

This is a stock Android 5.1 phone with decent display, runs fast, decent battery, and is FREAKING CHEAP.  If I break it I can buy 4 more before I spend the amount of newer phones.  I might buy another just to throw it at someone text walking with a Samsung or Apple phone.

I can use it as a hot spot because ATT can't reign down their corporate policy on me.  It has expandable memory, and dual sim.  Battery has been good so far.  Wish it had removable battery.

The one negative is the camera.  It isn't very good.  I can take pictures and they look decent depending on the lighting, but wouldn't rely on it for important moments.  I take pictures of my kid with a DSLR, but if you use your phone as a primary camera then I would still look for a cheaper phone with a better camera.

I got mine for $99, and am very impressed on the build quality and performance of this phone.","4.0 out of 5 stars"
